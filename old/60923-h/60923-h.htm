The First Adventure of the Rainbow Cat</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THERE was once a cat which was not in the
least like any cat you have ever seen, or I
either, for the matter of that. It was a fairy cat,
you see, and so you would rather expect it to be
different, wouldn&#8217;t you? It had a violet nose,
indigo eyes, pale blue ears, green front legs, a
yellow body, orange back legs and a red tail. In
fact, it was coloured with all the colours of the
rainbow, and on that account it was known as
the Rainbow Cat.</p>

<p>It lived, of course, in Fairyland, and it had all
sorts of strange adventures. I am going to tell
you some of them, and I think you will agree
with me that it really had a very thrilling time,
one way or another.</p>

<p>This is the first.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Rainbow Cat was sitting quietly at the
door of his house one sunny day. He felt rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
bored. Fairyland had been very quiet lately. &#8220;I
think it&#8217;s time I set out on a voyage of adventure,&#8221;
he said suddenly. &#8220;I shall get fat and
stupid if I don&#8217;t do something of the sort.&#8221; So
he shut up his house, put a notice on the door to
say that he hoped to be back some day, if not
sooner, and that letters and parcels were to be
thrown down the chimney, and started off on his
journey with a nice little wallet of assorted oddments
tied to his tail, together with a neat parcel
containing his party bow and his dancing-slippers.
&#8220;For one never knows,&#8221; said the Rainbow
Cat, &#8220;whom one may meet, and it is always well
to be prepared for anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went on and on until he came to the edge of
Fairyland, where the clouds begin.</p>

<p>&#8220;I may as well pay the cloud-folk a visit,&#8221;
thought he, and he began climbing up the clouds.</p>

<p>The people who live in the clouds are quite
pleasant creatures. They don&#8217;t do very much, but
being idle doesn&#8217;t seem to make them unhappy.
They live in splendid cloud-palaces that are even
more beautiful on the side which can&#8217;t be seen
from earth than on the side which can.</p>

<p>Often one may see them drifting across the
sky in companies, or driving their pearly chariots,
or sailing in their light boats. They live on air,
and the only thing they are really afraid of is the
Thunder Giant, who, when he gets angry&mdash;which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
he rather often does&mdash;goes stamping over the sky,
shouting and knocking their houses about.</p>

<p>They greeted the Rainbow Cat kindly and were
pleased to see him, for he was an old friend and
they were always glad to welcome visitors from
Fairyland.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have come just at the right moment,&#8221;
they said. &#8220;There is a grand party at the
Weather Clerk&#8217;s. His eldest son, the North
Wind, is to be married to-day to Princess Pearl,
the daughter of the King of the Enchanted Isles.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_013.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>The Rainbow Cat was pleased that he had
brought his party bow and his best shoes. His
bag of oddments might also come in useful, he
thought.</p>

<p>It was a wonderful wedding.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>Everybody went. Among the guests there
was even a comet, and comets attend none but
the smartest gatherings.</p>

<p>The Aurora Borealis looked magnificent, so
did the bride&#8217;s father, the King of the Enchanted
Isles, who was there with his lovely wife,
Mother o&#8217; Pearl.</p>

<p>There were one or two Bores present who had
to be asked because they were connected with
somebody or other, and another aged relation,
Anti Cyclone, a most disagreeable old lady; but
on the whole it was a charming affair.</p>

<p>Just as the merriment was at its height and
they were all happily feasting and rejoicing, a
friendly swallow came flying in with the news
that the Thunder Giant was tearing across the
sky in a terrible rage because a passing Trade
Wind, who was in a hurry, had trodden on his
toe.</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall we do?&#8221; said every one. &#8220;He&#8217;ll
spoil the party. He&#8217;ll upset everything.&#8221; And
they all ran about in great confusion and distress.</p>

<p>But the Rainbow Cat remained quite calm.
He was a very resourceful creature.</p>

<p>He retired under a table and opened his little
bag and examined its contents, thinking hard all
the time.</p>

<p>Presently he came out.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I can manage the Thunder Giant,&#8221; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
said. &#8220;Pray go on with the party. I will go and
meet him and see what can be done.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were all greatly astonished at his courage
and coolness, but they were delighted to think that
their party might not be spoiled after all, and they
crowded round to watch him go sailing off to
meet the giant, whose shoutings and mutterings
could by this time be clearly heard in the distance.</p>

<p>When the Rainbow Cat had gone some way
and could already see the giant from afar, he
stopped, opened his bag, and drew out a large
black cloak. This he put on, pulling the hood
well over his ears. He then sat down and
appeared to be lost in deep thought.</p>

<p>When the Thunder Giant came up he stood
still for a moment to look at this strange object
all alone in the middle of the sky.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you, and what are you doing here?&#8221;
he roared.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m the celebrated wizard Mewpus,&#8221; replied
the cat in a very deep and impressive voice.
&#8220;Mind my bag, there&#8217;s black magic in it. I have
heard of you, O great Thunder Giant.&#8221; And he
got up and bowed three times.</p>

<p>The giant felt rather flattered, but he was still
very cross and his foot hurt.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think much of wizards,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;What can you do?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>&#8220;I can tell your thoughts, O Giant,&#8221; was the
reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oho!&#8221; laughed the giant, &#8220;and pray what am
I thinking at this moment, Mr. Mewpus?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is quite easy,&#8221; said the Rainbow Cat.
&#8220;You are thinking how your foot is hurting you,
and how you would like to get hold of the person
who trod on your corns.&#8221; For the cat had heard
all this from the swallow.</p>

<p>The giant was astonished.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a rather wonderful fellow,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;It must be useful to be able to do that. Can&#8217;t
you teach me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I dare say I might be able to,&#8221; said the Rainbow
Cat. &#8220;I&#8217;ll see if you show any promise. Sit
down, please.&#8221;</p>

<p>The giant sat down and the Rainbow Cat
walked three times round him, muttering to
himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, tell me what I am thinking,&#8221; said he
when he had done.</p>

<p>The Thunder Giant sat looking at him rather
stupidly. He wasn&#8217;t a very clever person.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you&#8217;re thinking what a fool I look,
sitting here,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wonderful&mdash;wonderful,&#8221; said the cat. &#8220;You
show immense promise, sir. I have never had
such an apt pupil.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>&#8220;May I try again?&#8221; said the giant, who began
to think himself very clever.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; said the Rainbow Cat. &#8220;What
am I thinking of now?&#8221;</p>

<p>The giant tried to put on a very wise look
and stared again at the Rainbow Cat with his
stupid little eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Beefsteak and onions,&#8221; he said suddenly.</p>

<p>The Rainbow Cat fell back and pretended to
be lost in admiration.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perfectly right,&#8221; he said. &#8220;How did you
guess such a thing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it just came into my mind,&#8221; said the
giant modestly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know,&#8221; said the cat seriously, &#8220;you ought
to cultivate this gift. It&#8217;s most unusual.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can I do it?&#8221; said the giant eagerly, for
he thought it would be very delightful to be able
to read people&#8217;s thoughts. Which shows how
stupid he was.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go home,&#8221; said the cat, &#8220;and lie down for a
couple of hours. Then take these three little pink
comfits and lie down for another couple of hours.
After that you may get up and have a cup of tea.
But keep very quiet. Before going to bed eat this
other little white comfit, and when you wake up
in the morning you will be able to read people&#8217;s
thoughts.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>The giant was all impatience to be gone, but he
did not quite forget his manners.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very much obliged to you,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Can&#8217;t I do anything for you in exchange, Professor
Mewpus?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Rainbow Cat pondered for a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like a bit of lightning,&#8221; he said, &#8220;a
nice jumpy bit.&#8221;</p>

<p>The giant put his hand in his pocket. &#8220;Here&#8217;s
a bundle of it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If you cut the string
you can have quite a jolly little display at any
moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Rainbow Cat thanked him, and they
parted most amicably.</p>

<p>The giant went back to his castle and did as
he had been told. Ever since that day he believes
he knows what people are thinking. This makes
him feel very superior and it really doesn&#8217;t do
any one else any harm.</p>

<p>The Rainbow Cat returned to the party with
the bundle of lightning stowed carefully away in
his bag. Every one was most grateful for what
he had done, and he was quite overwhelmed with
attentions. He enjoyed himself very much in
Cloud-land, and stayed for seven days. At the
end of that time he packed up his little bag and
set off once more on his travels, and you shall
presently hear what next befell him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><small>TWO</small><br />

The Princess Who Could Not Cry</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THERE was once a little princess who could
not cry.</p>

<p>That wouldn&#8217;t have mattered so very much, but
the trouble was that she laughed at everything,
often on the most unsuitable occasions, and this
was an extremely vexing and awkward habit,
especially for a princess.</p>

<p>Her parents were very troubled about it, and
they called in a wise old fairy in order to get her
advice. She went into the matter thoroughly, and
finally told them that if the princess could only
once be made to cry, the spell would be broken for
ever and she would thenceforward be just like
other people.</p>

<p>This wasn&#8217;t particularly helpful, but it gave
them some hope, and they immediately set about
the task of making the princess weep. Of course
it was a rather difficult matter, because naturally
they didn&#8217;t want her to be really miserable, and
they hardly knew how to begin. Finally they
offered a reward of five hundred crowns to
anybody who should succeed in making their
daughter cry without doing her any harm.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>Wise men came from all over the kingdom to
see what they could do, and many things were
tried, but all to no purpose.</p>

<p>One of them suggested that she should be shut
up in a room by herself and fed on bread and
water for a whole week. The queen thought this
very cruel, but the king persuaded her to try it.
She insisted, however, that at any rate it should
be bread and <i>milk</i>. But every time they came to
bring the princess her basin of bread and milk
they found her laughing, and at the end of the
week she was still as cheerful as ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look,&#8221; she said, &#8220;my feet have grown so thin
that I can&#8217;t keep my slippers on.&#8221; And she kicked
her foot into the air and sent her slipper flying
across the room, and laughed to see the scandalised
face of the butler.</p>

<p>But her mother burst into tears. &#8220;My poor
starved lamb,&#8221; she said, &#8220;they shall not treat you
so any longer.&#8221; And she rushed into the kitchen
and ordered soup and chicken and pink jelly to be
sent up to the princess for her next meal.</p>

<p>Another wise man came who said that for six
months he had been practising pulling the most
awful faces and making the most terrible noises
imaginable, in order to be able to cure the princess.
Children, he said, were so frightened by him that
they had to be carried shrieking and howling
from the room, and even grown-up people were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
so terrified that they wept aloud. He requested
that he might be left alone with the princess; but
the queen waited outside the door and listened.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_021.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>She trembled with anxiety as she stood there,
for the noises the wise man made were so bloodcurdling
that she could hardly bear to hear them
herself, and it seemed dreadful that her child
should be left alone to endure such a trial. But
in a few minutes she heard peals of laughter coming
from inside the room, and presently the wise
man opened the door. He was quite done up, and
blue in the face, with the efforts he had been
making. &#8220;It&#8217;s no use,&#8221; he said rather crossly.
&#8220;No use at all,&#8221; and went away looking much
annoyed.</p>

<p>The princess came running out to her mother.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, he <i>was</i> a funny man,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Can&#8217;t
he come and do it again?&#8221;</p>

<p>Another wise man suggested that all her
favourite toys should be broken up. But when
he went into the nursery and began smashing her
beautiful dolls and playthings, the princess
clapped her hands and jumped about and laughed
more heartily than ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;What fun, what fun,&#8221; she said, and she too
began throwing the things about. So that plan
had to be given up also.</p>

<p>Other wise men came, but as many of their
suggestions were cruel and unkind ones, naturally
the king and queen would not hear of them,
and at last they began to fear that nothing could
be done.</p>

<p>Now in a small village on the borders of the
king&#8217;s great park, there lived a widow with her
little daughter Marigold.</p>

<p>They were very poor, and the mother earned
what she could by doing odd jobs of washing,
sewing, or cleaning for her neighbours. But
she fell ill, and poor Marigold was in great
trouble, for she had no money to buy comforts
for her mother.</p>

<p>Their little savings had to go for food to keep
them alive, and every day these grew less and less.</p>

<p>Marigold knew all about the little princess at
the castle. She had often heard speak of her, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
had even seen her sometimes riding about the
roads on her white pony. And one day as she
was cooking the midday meal an idea came into
her head.</p>

<p>As soon as dinner was over, she put on her hat
and cloak and told her mother that she was going
up to the king&#8217;s palace to see if she could make
the princess cry and so earn the five hundred
crowns.</p>

<p>Her mother did her best to persuade her not
to go.</p>

<p>&#8220;How can you hope to succeed,&#8221; she said, &#8220;when
so many clever people have tried and failed? You
are my own dear little Marigold, but it is useless
for you to attempt such a task. Give it up, my
child.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Marigold was determined, and when her
mother saw this she said no more, but lay and
watched her rather sadly as she set bravely off
for the castle with her little basket over her arm.</p>

<p>When Marigold came to the castle gates she
felt frightened. The gates were so big and she
was so small. But she thought of her mother and
of the five hundred crowns which would buy her
everything she needed, and she stood on tiptoe on
the top step and pulled the bell handle so hard that
she was quite frightened at the noise it made.</p>

<p>A very grand footman opened the door, and
when he saw Marigold standing there in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
woollen frock and cloak with her little basket, he
said, &#8220;Back entrance!&#8221; in a loud, cross voice, and
shut the door in her face.</p>

<p>So she went round to the back entrance. This
time the door was opened by a red-faced kitchen-maid.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve no dripping to give away to-day,&#8221;
she said, and she too was about to shut the door.</p>

<p>But the queen happened to be in the kitchen
giving her orders for the day, and she saw Marigold
through the window. She came to the
window and called to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, my child?&#8221; she asked, for Marigold
stood there looking the picture of unhappiness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve come to make the princess cry, please
your Majesty,&#8221; she said, and made a curtsey, for
the queen looked very magnificent with her crown
on her head and her lovely ermine train held up
over her arm to keep it off the kitchen floor.</p>

<p>When the queen heard what Marigold had
come for, she smiled and shook her head, for how
could a little country girl hope to do what so many
wise men had been unable to accomplish? But
Marigold was so earnest and so sure that she
could make the princess cry that at last the queen
promised to let her attempt it.</p>

<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t hurt her?&#8221; she said. But she
smiled as she said it. Marigold had such a kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
little face; she did not look as if she could hurt
any one.</p>

<p>She was taken to the princess&#8217;s apartments,
and the queen went with her into the nursery
and introduced her to the princess and explained
why she had come.</p>

<p>The princess was delighted to see a nice little
rosy-cheeked girl instead of the dull old men who
so often came to visit her. The queen shut the
door and left them alone together.</p>

<p>By this time the news of the little village girl
who had come to make the princess cry, had
spread all over the palace; and presently a whole
crowd of people were standing anxiously waiting
outside the nursery door.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s such nonsense,&#8221; said the Chamberlain to
the Prime Minister. &#8220;A village child. I don&#8217;t
suppose she&#8217;s ever been outside the village.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite ridiculous,&#8221; whispered the ladies-in-waiting
to the court pages. &#8220;Do you think she
knows how to make a correct curtsey?&#8221;</p>

<p>At last the king and queen could stand the suspense
no longer. They quietly opened the door
and peeped in. And what do you think they saw?
The princess, standing at the table in the middle
of the room with Marigold&#8217;s basket in front of
her, busily peeling onions as hard as she could go,
while the tears streamed down her face all the
while. She was crying at last!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>The king and queen rushed in and clasped her
in their arms, onions and all. The ladies-in-waiting
stood with their perfumed handkerchiefs
pressed to their noses, the pages tittered, and the
cook, who was standing at the bottom of the
stairs, muttered to himself when he heard the
news, &#8220;Well, <i>I</i> could have done that,&#8221; while the
Prime Minister rushed about the room with his wig
on one side and shook everybody violently by the
hand, exclaiming, &#8220;Wonderful, wonderful! And
so simple! We must get out a proclamation at once.
Where are my spectacles? Where is my pen?&#8221;</p>

<p>And so the princess was cured, and from that
time she became like everybody else and cried
when she was unhappy and laughed when she
was glad, though I am pleased to say that she
always laughed a great deal more than she cried.</p>

<p>As for Marigold, she got her five hundred
crowns, of course, and was able to give her
mother everything she needed, so that she was
soon quite well. The king and queen were most
grateful, and often invited her up to the palace to
play with their little daughter, and loaded her
with presents.</p>

<p>Because she was sweet and modest she didn&#8217;t
get spoiled, but grew up charming, kind and
beautiful. I did hear that in the end she married
a king&#8217;s son and that they had an onion for their
crest, but I&#8217;m not at all sure about that.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><small>THREE</small><br />

The Prince and the Baker&#8217;s Daughter</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THERE was once a prince who was very
brave, good and handsome. He was quite
young, too, and before he settled down to learning
how to rule the kingdom which would one day be
his, he was sent by his father out a-travelling into
the world.</p>

<p>The king gave his son a beautiful white horse
and a bagful of big gold pieces, and told him to
come back when the money was all spent.</p>

<p>His mother made him a blue velvet mantle
embroidered with silver, and she also gave him a
hat with a blue feather in it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want my son to look nice when he goes out
riding into the world,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>He rode away on his white horse and turned
to wave his hand to his mother and father before
he went over the hill-top.</p>

<p>&#8220;How handsome he looks,&#8221; said his mother,
wiping away a tear or two.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s nothing to cry about,&#8221; said his
father, and blew his nose. Then they went back
into the palace and continued ruling.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>The prince rode on and on.</p>

<p>Wherever he went people were very nice to
him, even when he got beyond the borders of his
own kingdom where he was no longer known.</p>

<p>It is not every day that a handsome prince
comes riding along on a white horse, and moreover
with a bagful of fine gold pieces to spend.</p>

<p>All the girls ran out to look at him as he passed,
and when he stayed anywhere, even for a short
time, people seemed to get to know about it at once
and asked him to their houses and gave grand
parties in his honour and made so much of him
altogether that he was in some danger of getting
thoroughly spoiled.</p>

<p>But he had been very well brought up, and he
had a naturally amiable disposition.</p>

<p>Besides, he had always been told by his mother
that if you are a prince you must try hard to
behave as a prince should, and be modest, considerate,
and very polite to every one.</p>

<p>One morning close on midday, he came to a
tiny village which he did not know at all.</p>

<p>He was rather hungry after his ride, and as
he passed down the narrow little street he became
aware of a delicious smell of new bread.</p>

<p>It came from the open door of the village
baker&#8217;s, and as he glanced in he saw a pile of
beautiful, crisp new rolls heaped up in a big white
basket.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>He got down off his horse and went in.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like to buy one of those nice little
rolls,&#8221; he said to the baker&#8217;s daughter, who stood
behind the counter.</p>

<p>She was very pretty. She had blue, shining
eyes and fair smooth hair, and when she smiled
it was like sunshine on a flowery meadow.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_029.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>The prince ate up his roll and then another and
yet another, and while he ate he talked to the
baker&#8217;s daughter. But no one can eat more than
three rolls one after another, and at last he felt
that the time had come to pay for what he had
had and ride on his way.</p>

<p>But, as it happened, he had no small change,
nothing but a gold piece such as those which he
had in his bag.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>The baker&#8217;s daughter hadn&#8217;t enough money in
the whole shop to change such a big gold piece,
her father having set off that very morning with
all the money in the till in order to buy a sack of
flour from the miller in the next village.</p>

<p>She had never even seen so large a gold coin
before. She wanted to give him the rolls for
nothing, but of course he wouldn&#8217;t hear of that,
and when he said it didn&#8217;t matter about the
change she wouldn&#8217;t hear of that either.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then there&#8217;s nothing for it,&#8221; said the prince,
&#8220;but for me to stay in the village until I have
eaten as much as my gold piece will pay for.&#8221;</p>

<p>As a matter of fact he was really quite glad of
an excuse to stay, the baker&#8217;s daughter was so
very pretty, and he was getting a little tired of
travelling.</p>

<p>He pottered about in the bakehouse all the
afternoon and watched her making the dough for
her delicious rolls.</p>

<p>He even offered to help her.</p>

<p>His blue mantle got rather floury, but he didn&#8217;t
mind that in the least.</p>

<p>The baker&#8217;s daughter was rather worried that
such a fine gentleman should get in such a mess.</p>

<p>She didn&#8217;t know he was a prince, otherwise
she might have been more worried still.</p>

<p>In the evening, when the baker returned, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
prince asked if he could put him up for a couple
of nights.</p>

<p>The baker was a kindly and simple old soul.
&#8220;Gladly, gladly,&#8221; he said, rubbing his hands
together and smiling, for the village was a small
one and they were very poor, and he was glad to
make a little extra money.</p>

<p>The prince stayed a whole week at the baker&#8217;s
house. By that time, what with the bread he had
eaten&mdash;though he was careful not to eat much
and always to choose the cheapest&mdash;and the price
of his lodging, about half of the gold piece was
spent, and the baker&#8217;s daughter was able to give
him the change from the money she had taken in
the shop.</p>

<p>So he had no excuse for staying any longer,
which grieved him because he had grown very
fond of the baker&#8217;s daughter and did not like
leaving her.</p>

<p>But he had an idea that his mother and father
would not think her a very suitable bride for him,
for princes cannot always marry whom they
please, and so he rode sadly away.</p>

<p>But the farther he went the sadder he became,
and at the end of two months he could bear it no
longer, and so one fine morning he turned his
horse&#8217;s head round and rode back again the way
he had come.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is good and clever and beautiful,&#8221; he said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
&#8220;What more can one want in a wife? When my
mother and father see her they will love her as
much as I do and will be quite willing that I
should marry her.&#8221; Which really was very
optimistic of him.</p>

<p>But alas, when he came to the village and
sought the baker&#8217;s shop, he was met by strange
faces.</p>

<p>The baker had died a month since, he was told,
and his daughter had left the village and gone out
into the world to work for her living, for she
could not manage the bakehouse by herself and
there was none to help her now that her father
was gone.</p>

<p>The prince was very, very troubled and unhappy.
He tried to find out something more
about her, but his efforts were fruitless; no one
seemed to know what had become of her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will search the world over till I find her,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;even if it take me the whole of my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>He wandered on and on, always making fresh
inquiries, always hoping to hear something of his
lost love, but always in vain.</p>

<p>And at last he got back to his own kingdom.</p>

<p>When his mother and father saw him they
were horrified to find how pale and thin he had
grown.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_032fp.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption">HE RODE AWAY ON HIS WHITE HORSE AND
TURNED TO WAVE HIS HAND TO HIS MOTHER
AND FATHER BEFORE HE WENT OVER THE HILL-TOP.</p>



<p>&#8220;Travelling doesn&#8217;t seem to suit you, my son,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
said his father, looking at him rather seriously
and stroking his beard.</p>

<p>&#8220;The poor boy is tired out,&#8221; said his mother.
&#8220;He&#8217;ll look better when he&#8217;s had a good rest and
some proper food. I don&#8217;t suppose he&#8217;s ever had
a really wholesome meal in those foreign parts.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the prince remained thin and sad and listless,
and at last he told his father and mother
the cause of his unhappiness. At first they were
a little upset at the idea of his wanting to marry
so humble a person as the daughter of a village
baker&mdash;&#8220;But that of course,&#8221; thought the prince,
&#8220;is only because they don&#8217;t know her.&#8221;</p>

<p>And after a time, when they saw how unhappy
he was and that all the distractions with which
they provided him were unavailing, and that his
one idea was to go out into the world again and
search for the baker&#8217;s daughter, they were so
troubled that they felt they would be only too
glad if he could have the wish of his heart
fulfilled.</p>

<p>And then one day as the prince was sitting
quietly at breakfast with his parents he jumped
up suddenly with an expression of the greatest
excitement and joy.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, my son?&#8221; said his astonished
mother.</p>

<p>The prince couldn&#8217;t speak for a moment. For
one thing he was too excited, and for another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
his mouth was full of bread, and I told you before
how well brought up he was.</p>

<p>But he pointed to the dish of breakfast rolls
and kept on nodding his head and swallowing as
hard as he could.</p>

<p>The king and queen thought at first that sorrow
had affected his brain, but the prince was
able to explain very soon. &#8220;The rolls, the rolls,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Her rolls, <i>hers</i>. No one else could
make them so good. She must be here.&#8221; And
he rushed off to the kitchen without further ado.</p>

<p>And there, sure enough, he found the baker&#8217;s
daughter, peeling potatoes over the sink.</p>

<p>By the merest chance she had taken a place as
kitchen-maid in the king&#8217;s palace, though she
hadn&#8217;t the faintest idea, when she did so, that
the king&#8217;s son was the same person as the handsome
stranger who had once stayed in her
father&#8217;s house.</p>

<p>And though she had been there a month she
had never seen him. How should she? King&#8217;s
palaces are big places, and the kitchen-maids stay
in the kitchen premises, so that she and the prince
might never have come face to face at all if it had
not happened that, owing to the illness of the
royal roll-maker, she had undertaken to make the
breakfast rolls that morning.</p>

<p>When the king and queen saw how sweet and
beautiful she was they made no objection to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
as a bride for their son, and so he asked her at
once to marry him, which she consented to do, for
she loved him as much as he loved her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that I should have <i>chosen</i> a
baker&#8217;s daughter for our son&#8217;s wife,&#8221; said the
queen to her husband when they talked it over
that evening. &#8220;But she&#8217;s certainly a charming
girl, and quite nice people go into business nowadays.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll make him an excellent wife,&#8221; said the
king. &#8220;Those rolls were delicious.&#8221;</p>

<p>So they got married quite soon after. The
wedding was a rather quiet one because the bride
was in mourning for her father, whom she had
loved dearly. All the same, it was a very nice
affair, and everybody was most jolly and gay.
The prince and his wife had a beautiful house not
very far from the palace, and I think it is
extremely likely that they lived happily ever after.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><small>FOUR</small><br />

Why Pigs Have Curly Tails</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THERE was once a fairy who fell into a
bramble-bush. It was a very closely grown
bush, and she could not get out. She was sadly
scratched, and the thorns caught her tiny delicate
wings and tore her pretty frail dress into shreds.</p>

<p>The bramble-bush formed part of a hedge
which ran along the side of an orchard, and
presently a horse came sauntering up to the
hedge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, please help me, sir,&#8221; said the fairy. &#8220;I&#8217;m
caught in a bramble-bush, and can&#8217;t get out.&#8221;</p>

<p>The horse came and looked at her. &#8220;That&#8217;s
a nasty place to be in,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What will you
give me if I get you out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you a golden halter and a silver bit,&#8221;
said the fairy.</p>

<p>The horse shook his head. &#8220;It&#8217;s not worth it,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;I should scratch my face. My master
loves me for my beautiful satin skin, and I really
can&#8217;t risk spoiling my appearance. Besides, I
have some very nice harness of my own. He sees
to that. Sorry I can&#8217;t be of any assistance.&#8221; And
he ambled away.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>A little later a robin perched on the bramble-bush.
&#8220;Oh, please, Mr. Robin, won&#8217;t you come
and help me?&#8221; said the fairy. &#8220;I can&#8217;t get out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What will you give me,&#8221; said the robin, &#8220;if I
help you out?&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_037.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you a jacket of gold and slippers of
silver,&#8221; said the fairy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you very much,&#8221; said the robin, &#8220;but I
don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s quite my style. I have a nice
red waistcoat already and I should hate to look
gaudy. Besides, I&#8217;m tremendously busy. I&#8217;ve
got a young family to look after, and my wife
doesn&#8217;t like me to be away long.&#8221; And he flew off.</p>

<p>There were sheep grazing in the field on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
other side of the hedge, and one of them came
munching close to the bramble-bush.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, please, Mrs. Sheep,&#8221; said the fairy, &#8220;can
you help me out of here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What will you give me if I do?&#8221; said the
sheep.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will teach you to sing as the fairies sing,&#8221;
said the fairy. &#8220;I will also give you wisdom.&#8221;
For she was getting more and more anxious, and
she thought such lovely gifts would tempt the
sheep.</p>

<p>But the sheep stared stupidly with her glassy
eyes. &#8220;That&#8217;s all very well,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;but I
happen to have a very nice voice naturally and can
already sing rather well. As for wisdom, I don&#8217;t
quite know what that is, but I don&#8217;t think it
sounds very interesting. I&#8217;d help you gladly, but
the thorns would tear my fine woollen coat, and
that would never do. Surely a fine woollen coat
is worth much more than wisdom.&#8221; And she
moved away.</p>

<p>The fairy was beginning to despair; she
thought she would never, never be able to get
back to Fairyland. But just as she had given up
hope, a pig came wandering past, making ugly
noises and staring about with his little blue eyes.
He spied the fairy sitting in the midst of the
bramble-bush with her head down on her knees.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; said the pig.</p>

<p>The fairy raised her head and saw the pig&#8217;s
ugly pink snout poking in between the bramble-twigs.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I can get you out,&#8221; he said, when she
had told him her trouble. &#8220;I&#8217;m not much to look
at, but I&#8217;ve got a good tough hide, and at any rate
I shan&#8217;t be afraid of a few scratches spoiling my
beauty.&#8221; So with a good many snuffles and
grunts he pushed his head and shoulders well into
the middle of the bush and made a clear way for
the fairy to get out.</p>

<p>She gave a sigh of relief when she found herself
once more free and in the clear sunshine, and
the pig stood and looked at her admiringly, for
she was a dear little thing. He was so conscious
of his ugliness beside her pretty grace that he
turned away and started off down the orchard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go&mdash;oh, don&#8217;t go,&#8221; said the fairy.</p>

<p>The pig turned round.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve not had your reward,&#8221; said the fairy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want any reward, thank you,&#8221; grunted
the pig, and moved on.</p>

<p>But the fairy persisted. She flew after him.
&#8220;You must have a reward,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I shall be
most unhappy if you don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t want anything, thank you,&#8221; said
the pig. &#8220;I have been very glad to help you.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>The fairy stood in front of him, anxiously
pondering as to what she could possibly give him
that might be of any use. Nobody seemed to
want her fairy gifts. She looked him up and
down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t you like something&mdash;something to
make you more beautiful?&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>She really meant less ugly, but she was so
grateful to the pig that she was very anxious not
to hurt his feelings, and so she put it that way.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid it&#8217;s rather hopeless,&#8221; said the pig,
with half a smile. &#8220;You see, I&#8217;m such an ugly
fellow. You&#8217;d have to alter me all over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But surely&mdash;a little something ...&#8221; said the
fairy, and she looked at him more thoughtfully
than ever.</p>

<p>Now all this happened a very long time
ago, when pigs had quite straight tails like most
of the other animals, and suddenly, looking at
his tail, the fairy had an idea. &#8220;I know, I
know,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You shall have a curly tail.
It will be an immense improvement, and <i>so</i>
uncommon.&#8221;</p>

<p>The pig looked rather pleased. &#8220;Well, have
your own way,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I can&#8217;t see my own
tail, in any case, but I dare say it wouldn&#8217;t look
bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the fairy touched the pig&#8217;s tail with her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
wand, and it instantly curled up into nice little
rings.</p>

<p>Ever since that day pigs have had curly tails,
and now you know how they came by this beautiful
adornment.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><small>FIVE</small><br />

The Second Adventure of the Rainbow
Cat</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE Rainbow Cat went on and on until at
last he came to the country of the Tree-goblins.
The Tree-goblins are happy people;
they live in the trees like birds, though they can&#8217;t
fly. They are indeed very friendly with the
birds, and they understand the bird language, so
that they are able to send one another messages
without any need of the post&mdash;which is very
convenient!</p>

<p>When winter comes the goblins go and live in
their caves underground. It is a great change
after the trees, and they are always delighted
when spring returns again.</p>

<p>There are no animals in Tree-goblin-land, but
the Rainbow Cat was an old friend here too, and
was received as kindly as in Cloud-land.</p>

<p>The Tree-goblins are rather funny little
creatures; they like to keep themselves <i>to</i> themselves,
as the saying goes, and there are not even
any fairies living in their country. But they are
on very friendly terms with the fairy folk, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
their principal occupation is making fairy clothes.</p>

<p>These are the tiniest, finest little garments
imaginable, and they are made of all sorts of
pretty things. Spider thread, of course, and
moonbeams, and softest silk from silk-worms,
and flower-petals dipped in magic wells so that
they cannot fade, and thistledown, and moss-velvet,
and foam, and lichen&mdash;oh, there is no end
to the things that are used to make clothes for
the fairies.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_043.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>And when they are finished the birds carry
them to the fairies and bring back orders. Sometimes,
when it&#8217;s a very special occasion, the fairies
come to be fitted or to choose the stuffs and the
styles, but not often.</p>

<p>They are easy to fit and easy to suit, and the
birds do the ordering most satisfactorily.</p>

<p>The Rainbow Cat liked being in Tree-goblin-land
very much indeed.</p>

<p>He lived in a beautiful copper-beech. When
the morning sun shone through the leaves his
little house was filled with a lovely rosy light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
which was most pleasing and becoming. Every
morning a chorus of little birds sang songs to
him for his delight, and every evening they lulled
him to sleep with soft lullabies.</p>

<p>They thought him a very grand and beautiful
person, and so indeed he was.</p>

<p>When he had been in Tree-goblin-land for two
or three days the Chief of the Goblins came to see
him one morning early. He was in great trouble.</p>

<p>The Queen of the Fairies had sent an order for
rose-coloured shoes, dozens and dozens of pairs.
She wanted all the Court to wear rose-coloured
shoes at her next party, and her next party was
to take place in three days.</p>

<p>&#8220;We could get the work done,&#8221; said the Chief
Goblin anxiously, &#8220;it isn&#8217;t that. But we haven&#8217;t
got the material. You see, the roses aren&#8217;t out
yet. There&#8217;s been a great run on pink lately and
we&#8217;ve used up all the pink flowers and all our
other stuffs of that colour. We&#8217;ve scarcely got
an inch of rose-colour of any kind, and we ought
to start at once. It&#8217;ll take us all our time to get
them made. It would be dreadful to disappoint
the Queen. What are we to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Rainbow Cat was more than willing to
help, but he felt that it was a difficult matter.</p>

<p>&#8220;How soon must you have the stuff?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;This afternoon would be the very latest,&#8221; said
the goblin.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see what I can do,&#8221; said the Rainbow Cat.
&#8220;I have an idea or two. Don&#8217;t worry, it&#8217;ll be all
right. Meet me here at noon, and I&#8217;ll let you
know what I&#8217;ve done.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Chief Goblin went away feeling considerably
relieved. The Rainbow Cat seemed so wise,
just the kind of person to think of something
helpful in an emergency.</p>

<p>And sure enough at twelve o&#8217;clock he came to
meet the Chief of the Goblins with a cheerful
twinkle in his dark blue eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been making a few inquiries,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;But I want to make sure that my information is
correct. Sit down, and let us have a little quiet
talk.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Chief of the Goblins sat down and waited
eagerly. He felt more and more hopeful.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it true,&#8221; said the Rainbow Cat, &#8220;is it true
that the crooked hawthorn tree in the Weeshy
Glen is very bad-tempered?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite true,&#8221; said the Chief Goblin. &#8220;Nobody
dares go near him, he&#8217;s such a cross, cantankerous
creature. Lots of the hawthorns are very nice
indeed, and we&#8217;re very fond of them. But he&#8217;s
unbearable. He&#8217;ll give any one a nasty scratch if
he gets half a chance, he&#8217;s so spiteful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it true,&#8221; continued the Rainbow Cat, &#8220;that
he&#8217;s jealous of the other trees because he can&#8217;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
grow tall and big like them, and reach up to the
sky?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite true,&#8221; said the Chief Goblin. &#8220;He
makes every one round him miserable with his
grumbling and scolding.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m,&#8221; said the Rainbow Cat, and he folded
his arms and sat lost in thought for a few
minutes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would the petals of the hawthorn tree do to
make fairy shoes of?&#8221; he said at last.</p>

<p>&#8220;Beautifully,&#8221; said the Chief Goblin. &#8220;But
they&#8217;re white.&#8221; (For at that time all hawthorn
blossom was white, both in Fairyland and everywhere
else.)</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite true,&#8221; said the Rainbow Cat. &#8220;Can you
lend me a mandolin?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I think I can,&#8221; said the goblin, and he ran
off and came back very soon with a beautiful
mandolin all inlaid with silver and ivory and
mother-of-pearl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said the Rainbow Cat. &#8220;I think
that in half an hour or so I shall be able to let you
have all the rose-coloured petals you want.&#8221; And
he hung the mandolin round his neck and set off
into the forest.</p>

<p>Presently he came to the Weeshy Glen, sat
down a little way off from the hawthorn tree
where its thorns could not possibly touch him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
tuned up his mandolin, and began to sing this
little song:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="versefirst">&#8220;The oak tree raises his arms on high,</div>
<div class="verse">The pine tree reaches up to the sky,</div>
<div class="verse">The slender birch is a lady fair,</div>
<div class="verse">The poplar has a most elegant air.</div>
<div class="verse">But tell, oh tell me now, who is this</div>
<div class="verse">Small and stunted and all amiss?</div>
<div class="verse">Who can he be? oh, who can he be?</div>
<div class="verse">This squat little, odd little, strange little tree?&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t very kind of the Rainbow Cat, but
the hawthorn tree was a very disagreeable fellow,
you must remember, and nobody could ever do
anything to punish him because every one was so
afraid of his sharp thorns.</p>

<p>Anyway, by the time the Rainbow Cat had got
to the end of the first verse, the hawthorn tree
was very angry. He could hardly contain himself,
and he trembled all over with the temper
he was in.</p>

<p>The cat hardly looked at him, but went cheerfully
on with his song.</p>

<p>This was the second verse:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="versefirst">&#8220;The elm tree stands like a stately king,</div>
<div class="verse">The leaves of the alder dance and sing,</div>
<div class="verse">My lady beech is a courtly dame,</div>
<div class="verse">The chestnut&#8217;s lamps are a shining flame.</div>
<div class="verse">But tell me, tell me, who can he be</div>
<div class="verse">That scarcely reaches up to their knee?</div>
<div class="verse">Hoary of head and crooked of limb,</div>
<div class="verse">What on earth is the matter with him?&#8221;</div>
</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>The hawthorn tree had grown more and more
furious as the song went on. The Rainbow Cat
finished up with a beautiful trill when he got to
&#8220;the matter with him,&#8221; but the hawthorn tree was
in no mood to admire his fine singing. So great
was his rage that he grew pinker and pinker and
pinker, and he shook so violently that all his petals
were shaken down. They fell all round him like
a shower of rosy rain.</p>

<p>The Rainbow Cat waited no longer. He ran off
as hard as he could to the Chief of the Goblins,
still singing as he went, and told him that he would
find all the stuff he wanted in the Weeshy Glen.</p>

<p>So the Queen got the rose-coloured shoes after
all, and the Tree-goblins were most grateful to
the Rainbow Cat, and begged him to stay with
them as long as he liked.</p>

<p>But he thanked them and said he must continue
his travels.</p>

<p>They wanted to load him with presents, but all
he would take was a little bottle of water from the
magic well. This water has fairy powers. If you
rub it on your eyes you can see through stone
walls, which is sometimes very convenient, and
the Rainbow Cat was quite pleased to have some.</p>

<p>They also insisted that he should keep the mandolin.
This he finally consented to do. And ever
since that time there have always been pink
hawthorn trees as well as white.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><small>SIX</small><br />

Mellidora</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THERE was once a young prince who wished
to take a wife. So he went to consult his
aunt, who was by way of being a Wise Woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Next week,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the King of the Land-on-the-other-side-of-the-Mountains
is holding a
great festival in honour of the coming of age of
his son, and he has invited me to stay at the Court.
There will be many beautiful ladies there, and I
am hoping that I may be able to find a wife among
them. But how shall I know which to choose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall have my advice and welcome,&#8221; said
his aunt. &#8220;Choose a maiden who laughs when
others cry, and cries when others laugh, and you
will not go far wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>The prince thanked his aunt for her counsel
and went back home. He thought the advice she
had given him rather strange, but he had great
confidence in her wisdom. &#8220;And in any case,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;I can but go to the festival and see what
comes of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>There were indeed many lovely ladies at the
Court of the King of the Land-on-the-other-side-of-the-Mountains.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
The prince was quite dazzled
by their beauty and their wit. Each of them
seemed more charming than the last.</p>

<p>On the second day of the fte a picnic had been
arranged which was to take place in a woodland
glade some little way from the palace.</p>

<p>The road thither was rough and very muddy,
for there had been much rain the week before.</p>

<p>The princes and knights rode on horseback;
the ladies were conveyed in carriages gaily decked
with flowers and drawn by beautiful prancing
horses.</p>

<p>But it so happened that the horses of one of the
carriages became unmanageable. It turned over,
and the six ladies who rode in it were all tumbled
into the ditch at the side of the road.</p>

<p>It was a rather deep ditch, and there was water
at the bottom of it, so that it was quite a business
getting them all out, though fortunately none of
them was seriously hurt. The prince, who happened
to be riding beside the carriage, helped to
rescue them, and escorted them one by one, weeping,
to a seat on the bank, where they presented
a sorry spectacle with their pretty frocks all
muddy and bedraggled and their pretty hats all
on one side.</p>

<p>But when the prince came to the sixth lady he
found her, to his great astonishment, sitting at
the bottom of the ditch, laughing.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>Her hat had come off, her hair had come down,
she was bedaubed with mud from head to foot,
and her poor little hands were covered with nettle
stings.</p>

<p>But she laughed all the same.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must have looked so funny all tumbling
into the ditch,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I wish I could have
seen it. We&#8217;re still rather a funny sight, aren&#8217;t
we?&#8221;&mdash;and she looked down at herself and up at
the weeping ladies on the bank, and laughed
again.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_051.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>There was so much mud on her face that the
prince could not see what she really looked like,
but he remembered the words of his aunt.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the name of the sixth lady?&#8221; he
asked, when they had all been bundled off home.
&#8220;The one who laughed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Her name is Mellidora,&#8221; he was told.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>So in the evening he sought out Mellidora and
found that she was a most beautiful and charming
person, so much so that he lost his heart to
her forthwith.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I must do nothing in a hurry,&#8221; he said to
himself. &#8220;After all, there is the other half of
my aunt&#8217;s counsel to be considered. In any case,
it would perhaps seem a little strange if I asked
her to marry me quite so soon. We will see what
happens to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the next day all the ladies and gentlemen
who were staying in the castle were to go out
riding in the early morning.</p>

<p>The prince had slept late, and he stood for a
moment at his window looking down on the courtyard,
where there was a great bustling and
prancing and making ready.</p>

<p>Through the midst of all this an old peasant
woman was making her way.</p>

<p>She had a basket of eggs on her arm, and carefully
laid on the top of it was a round flat cake,
brown and spicy-looking, with a sugar heart in
the middle of it, surrounded by pink and white
sugar roses.</p>

<p>She had made it for a birthday gift for the
King&#8217;s son. But she was a little confused by all
the bustle in the courtyard, and scurried hither
and thither among the horses and people like a
frightened hen.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>Presently one of the King&#8217;s servants pushed
her out of the way. Her foot caught on the edge
of a stone; she tripped and fell.</p>

<p>The eggs rolled out of the basket. Plop!
Plop! they went on the stones.</p>

<p>There was a fine mess, and the beautiful cake
lay in the midst of it, in fragments.</p>

<p>The old woman was so vexed and upset that
she forgot everything but the misfortune that
had befallen her, and she stood in the middle of
the courtyard surrounded by her broken eggs,
scolding away at the top of her voice and shaking
her old umbrella at the whole gay crowd.</p>

<p>Everybody laughed; and indeed she was a
rather comical sight as she stood there shouting
and storming. Somebody threw her a gold piece,
which was kindly meant. But a gold piece
wouldn&#8217;t make her beautiful cake whole again.</p>

<p>Presently the whole party rode away through
the courtyard gates&mdash;all excepting one, and that
one no other than Mellidora.</p>

<p>She slipped down from her horse and went
swiftly across to where the old woman sat upon
the stone steps leading up to the big castle doors.
All her anger was gone, but she looked the picture
of misery.</p>

<p>The prince could see how Mellidora stooped to
pick up the broken cake and tried to put it
together again, and how kindly she put her arm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
round the old woman&#8217;s shoulder, coaxing her with
friendly words.</p>

<p>And when presently he came down into the
courtyard to see what more might be done, the
sun shone upon Mellidora&#8217;s gentle face, and he
saw that her eyes were full of tears.</p>

<p>Then the prince knew that he had indeed found
the one whom he sought, for here was a maiden
who not only laughed when others cried, but who
also cried when others laughed.</p>

<p>The old woman was taken to the King&#8217;s son,
where she was so kindly received that she forgot
all her troubles.</p>

<p>But the prince waited no longer.</p>

<p>That very same day he asked Mellidora to
marry him, and as she loved him as much as he
did her they got married very soon and lived
happily ever after.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak"><small>SEVEN</small><br />

The Clock</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THERE was once a little clock which had
gone steadily for years and years.</p>

<p>It was a good, conscientious little thing, pretty
too, but very modest, and it had always kept
splendid time.</p>

<p>Then it stopped suddenly one day exactly at
eleven. Its works were worn out, and the clock-maker
to whom it was sent for repairs returned
it with the message that it was not possible to
make it go again.</p>

<p>The people to whom it belonged decided to
leave it on the mantelshelf where it had always
stood. &#8220;It&#8217;s such a nice little thing,&#8221; they said,
&#8220;and some day we can have new works put into
it.&#8221; So there it stood without making a movement
or uttering the faintest tick. But it was
very unhappy. It felt that it was of no real use
in the world.</p>

<p>The other things in the room weren&#8217;t very nice
about it. They used to whisper to one another,
and the little clock caught an unkind word now
and then that made it unhappier than ever.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know why they keep it there. What
on earth&#8217;s the good of it if it doesn&#8217;t go?&#8221; said
the big grandfather clock. &#8220;It never was much
use anyway. No chime, and a very poor tick. Of
course it&#8217;s got no constitution to speak of.&#8221; And
his brazen face grew even shinier than it had
been before, and he gave a self-satisfied little
cough and then sang out his quarters as loudly
as ever he could.</p>

<p>The cuckoo clock, which lived in the hall, and
used to join in the talk when the door was open,
actually went so far as to make up a little rhyme
about it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo,&#8221; it sang. &#8220;What&#8217;s
the use of you? What&#8217;s the use of you? Cuckoo,
cuckoo.&#8221;</p>

<p>The chairs, which were Chippendale, and
tremendously proud of the fact, were quite as
rude.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no doubt about it,&#8221; they said, &#8220;quality
is what tells. You can&#8217;t expect a thing to last
unless it is really well made, inside and out. Perfect
workmanship will wear practically for ever.&#8221;
And they held up their backs as straight as could
be and curved their shapely arms and legs into the
most elegant lines imaginable.</p>

<p>The little Chelsea flower-seller and flute-player,
who stood on each side of the clock on the mantelshelf,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
were much kinder, and did their best to
console it.</p>

<p>They had always been on friendly terms with
it, and they used to peep round it and smile and
wave to one another.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_057.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;The Fairy Queen is probably coming to see us
soon,&#8221; said the flower-seller. &#8220;Perhaps she may
be able to help you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The little clock felt happier; it would be wonderful
to be introduced to the Fairy Queen, who
had often been to see the Chelsea figures but had
so far never taken notice of any of the other
things.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>You see, those two were old friends of hers.
They came from Fairyland originally, but the tale
went that a wicked witch had cast a spell over
them which was to last for seven hundred and
seventy-seven years. At the end of that time they
would be able to go back to Fairyland, but meanwhile
the Queen used to come and visit them now
and then in order to cheer them up. Sure enough,
the very next time she came, the flower-seller
remembered about the little clock and told her
how unhappy it was.</p>



<p>The Queen came and stood in front of it and
stroked its face with her tiny hand and patted its
pretty ormolu pillars.</p>

<p>Finally she sat down on the little green marble
slab on which it stood, and asked it to tell her all
its troubles.</p>

<p>And the little clock opened its heart to her and
told her how miserable it was to think that it
would never, never be able to tell the time again.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_058fp.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption">SHE PULLED A TINY DANDELION-CLOCK FROM
HER POCKET AND BEGAN TO BLOW AND TO
COUNT</p>

<p>&#8220;But you <i>will</i>,&#8221; said the Queen. &#8220;Every day
and every night at eleven o&#8217;clock you will be
exactly right. None of the other clocks&#8221;&mdash;she
glanced round almost contemptuously at the
grandfather&mdash;&#8220;can be quite sure of ever being
perfectly right. But you will be. Why, it must
be about eleven now.&#8221; She pulled a dandelion-clock
from her pocket and began to blow and
to count. &#8220;One, two, three, four....&#8221; The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
white darts floated away and went drifting about
the room. At last only one remained.</p>



<p>At that moment the cuckoo clock was heard
striking in the hall. The Queen stopped blowing
to listen.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s fast,&#8221; she said, and waited till he had
finished. &#8220;Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,
eleven,&#8221; she went on, and, as she ended, the last
white morsel of down rose in the air. She
glanced at the little clock. &#8220;You see, you&#8217;re quite
right,&#8221; she said triumphantly. &#8220;And to-morrow
morning you&#8217;ll be right again at eleven o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>

<p>The little clock beamed, and it beamed still
more when the Fairy Queen opened its glass door
and gently clasped its hands in hers and said how
much she looked forward to seeing it again.</p>

<p>Just then the grandfather cleared his throat
and went through his pompous performance of
chiming out the quarters and hour.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re five minutes slow,&#8221; said the Queen,
and she waved her hand and vanished through
the ventilator.</p>

The Moon</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE moon, of course, is a big golden penny
hung up in the sky. Every month when it
is at the full the fairies stand in the fields and
gaze at it and feel in their empty pockets. There
are so many things they want to buy. Rainbow
ribbon from the weather clerk for sashes, silken
thread from the spider for weaving into shawls,
pearl varnish from the snail for doing up their
wings, and little red feathers from the robin for
wearing in their Sunday bonnets.</p>

<p>At last they can bear it no longer. They all
go flying into the sky and unhook the moon and
carry it off to go marketing with. And when
they&#8217;re tired of spending they hang what is left
of it up again in the sky and go home to bed. But
the next night they fetch it again and spend a
little more.</p>

<p>They go on doing this night after night for
nearly a fortnight, and the moon gets smaller
and smaller, till at last there&#8217;s nothing left of it
at all. And when the fairies realise what they
have done, they get frightened.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>&#8220;We&#8217;ve spent all the moon,&#8221; they say. &#8220;Suppose
it never grew again! Wouldn&#8217;t it be dreadful?&#8221;
And they all hide away in the forest and
don&#8217;t come out for several nights.</p>

<p>But at last one of them takes courage and puts
his head out, and he sees a little tiny bit of moon
shining in the sky. Whereupon he gives a shout
and claps his hands and goes running round to
the houses of all the other fairies to tell them the
good news.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_061.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;The moon&#8217;s growing again,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Come
quick and look.&#8221; And they all come out to look
at it, and caper about and are as pleased as pleased
can be.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll never take it again,&#8221; they say. &#8220;It
might not grow next time.&#8221; But at the end of a
fortnight they have worn all their pretties a little
shabby, and they want some more. And by that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
time the moon has grown so big that they feel
that they <i>must</i> spend a little of it. And&mdash;would
you believe it?&mdash;they end up by doing all over
again just exactly what they did before.</p>

<p>They&#8217;ve been going on like this for ages, and
what&#8217;s more, they&#8217;re beginning to take it for
granted that the moon will grow again, and so I
don&#8217;t suppose they&#8217;ll ever get cured. But it&#8217;s very
tiresome of them.</p>

<p>We could quite well do with all the moon
always. Besides, some day it really might not
grow again. And what then...?</p>

The Third Adventure of the Rainbow Cat</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">WHEN the Rainbow Cat left the land of
the Tree-goblins he travelled for some
time until he came to a delightful country called
the Bountiful Land.</p>

<p>It was a marvellous country.</p>

<p>There were deep forests there, and great
meadows full of the loveliest flowers, such as
only grow in gardens in other countries; the
sky was nearly always blue, and the people who
lived in that land were happy and contented.
That is to say, they would have been but for one
thing.</p>

<p>In the very middle of the country there was
a great castle built high upon a rock, and in this
castle&mdash;so the inhabitants of the place told the
Rainbow Cat&mdash;there lived a cruel and wicked
giantess who tyrannised over the people and constantly
took away their goods, sometimes even
their children.</p>

<p>The Rainbow Cat did not meet with any one
who had actually seen the giantess face to face,
but terrible tales were told of her doings and of
her horrible appearance. She was three times the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
height of an ordinary man, it was said. Her hair
was like knotted ropes, her eyes flamed fire;
when she blew her nose, the sound was like thunder;
when she sneezed, forests swayed as beneath
a hurricane; when she stamped her foot, whole
villages collapsed.</p>

<p>Besides being a giantess she was reported to
be able to work magic, and that frightened the
people more than anything else.</p>

<p>On dark nights she would come down from
her castle, they told him, in a chariot drawn by
six dragons, and when the people heard the noise
of it they fled into their houses and locked the
doors and barred the windows. From within
they could hear their barns and granaries being
ransacked, and the opening of the doors of sheds
and stables, whence their best cattle and horses
were carried off.</p>

<p>But sometimes a great voice would be heard
shouting in the dark, &#8220;Throw out your treasures
or I will take your children.&#8221; Then the terrified
people opened their windows and threw out their
treasures in fear and trembling.</p>

<p>And notices would mysteriously appear in the
villages, threatening that unless certain things
were delivered up at the castle gates, the giantess
would come down and take a terrible revenge.</p>

<p>The things were conveyed up the rocky path
by terrified villagers, who left them in front of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
the gates as commanded. They always came back
with most alarming stories of what they had
observed.</p>

<p>One man had seen the giantess&#8217;s shoes being
cleaned by a servant in the courtyard. They were
as big, he said, as a hay waggon.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_065.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Another was so frightened by the sight of her
washing hanging out on the line that he ran all
the way home and did not get over it for weeks.</p>

<p>But the worst thing of all was that children
who had wandered a little way from home disappeared
and never came back.</p>

<p>Others who escaped would tell how an enormous
cloaked figure had suddenly sprung out
from behind a tree, seized one of their comrades,
and made off into the woods.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>The thing had grown so bad that people dare
not let their children out of their sight for a
moment, and they were growing so afraid of the
visits of the giantess that all happiness was
rapidly vanishing out of the land.</p>

<p>The fame of the Rainbow Cat&#8217;s wisdom had
already reached this country, and the people were
delighted to see him and implored him to come to
their assistance. The Rainbow Cat felt that this
was a very serious matter indeed, but he was
exceedingly sorry for the people and promised to
do all he could to help them.</p>

<p>So on the evening of the second day after his
arrival, he took his little bag, which contained,
among other things, the lightning which the
Thunder Giant had given him and the bottle of
fairy water from Tree-goblin-land, and quietly
set off for the castle of the giantess.</p>

<p>He said nothing of his purpose to the kind folk
with whom he was staying&mdash;he knew it would
only make them fearfully anxious.</p>

<p>He just said he was going out for a little walk
in order to think the matter over.</p>

<p>He climbed lightly and softly up the rocky path
until he came right under the castle walls.</p>

<p>There were two immense stone towers, one at
each end of the castle, and from the high chimney
of one of them great clouds of evil-looking smoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
were pouring forth&mdash;green and purple and
black.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aha,&#8221; said the Rainbow Cat to himself,
&#8220;that&#8217;s where she&#8217;s busy at her horrible tricks,
is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>So he sat down outside the tower, opened his
bag, and dabbed his eyes with water from his
little bottle, so that he was able to see right
through the wall into the inside of the tower.</p>

<p>To his great astonishment, he saw no giantess,
but a very nasty-looking old wizard with a long
grey beard and an enormously tall hat, who sat
in a large room in front of a great open fire.</p>

<p>All manner of strange and terrible-looking
things hung upon the walls of the room or were
stowed away in cupboards, and the floor and
tables were piled with books of magic.</p>

<p>A great bunch of keys hung from the girdle of
the wizard, who was busily stirring something
which was bubbling over the fire in a big black
pot, from which came the smoke that the Rainbow
Cat had noticed pouring from the chimney.</p>

<p>The firelight shone on the labels of the keys, so
that the Rainbow Cat was able to read what was
written on them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gold Chest&mdash;Silver Chest&mdash;Jewel Chest&mdash;Giantess&#8217;s
Room&mdash;Prisoners&#8217; Room&mdash;Giantess&#8217;s
Garden&#8221;: these were some of the names he read
on the labels, and he began to understand things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
a little better. But he thought he would make a
few more investigations. So he picked up his
little bag and walked softly off to the other end
of the castle, sat down on the ground at the foot
of the tower there, and again bathed his eyes with
fairy water.</p>

<p>This time he found himself looking into a big
room full of children.</p>

<p>They were all very busy.</p>

<p>Some of them were sorting strange-looking
herbs, some of them were grinding queer substances
with heavy stones, some of them were
anxiously measuring out liquids drop by drop
from one bottle into another.</p>

<p>They all looked pale and tired; they did not
laugh and talk over their work as one would
expect children to do.</p>

<p>And then the door of the room opened and in
walked&mdash;who but the giantess herself!</p>

<p>But imagine the surprise of the Rainbow Cat
upon discovering that, although she was indeed
immensely tall, she was otherwise by no means a
terrible-looking person, but had, on the contrary,
a sweet and charming face and beautiful golden
hair.</p>

<p>The children all came running up to her as soon
as she appeared, and seemed delighted to see her.
She bent down and lifted some of them up into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
her arms, and was so gentle and sweet with them
all that it was a joy to see her.</p>

<p>The Rainbow Cat lost no further time; he took
his mandolin, and sitting there at the foot of the
tower, he began playing a little tune.</p>

<p>He daren&#8217;t play very loud for fear the wizard
should hear him in the other tower, but fortunately
the wind was in the right direction, and
in any case he felt pretty certain that the wizard
was too much taken up with his enchantments to
pay attention to anything else.</p>

<p>But the giantess heard, for of course giantesses
have very much larger ears than ordinary people
and hear much better, and she put her head out of
the window and saw the Rainbow Cat sitting
there in the dusk and asked him who he was and
what he was doing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am a friend,&#8221; said the Rainbow Cat. &#8220;Help
me to come up.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the giantess let down her ribbon waist-belt
with the bag she kept her handkerchief in tied to
the bottom of it, and this was so large that the
Rainbow Cat was easily able to get into it
together with his precious bag and mandolin.</p>

<p>The giantess hauled him up to the window-sill
and asked him to come in and sit down and tell
her what he was doing there and all about himself,
for she saw that he was no ordinary creature.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
And when he had explained to her why he was
there and what he had learnt in the Bountiful
Country, she told him her own tale.</p>

<p>How the wicked magician had stolen her away
from home when she was quite young and had
brought her to this castle, and how he kept her
shut up, while with his magic spells he did all sorts
of evil things.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know the people think it is all my doing,&#8221;
said the poor giantess. &#8220;He can turn an old
wash-tub and six beans into a chariot drawn by
flaming dragons, and when he flies out he wears
a great cloak over his tall hat, so that every one
takes him for me.</p>

<p>&#8220;He makes these poor children help him in his
wicked work, and keeps them prisoners just as
he does me.</p>

<p>&#8220;He does not even give us enough to eat. If
we are not soon rescued we shall all die. He
grows worse every day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Big tears fell from the giantess&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<p>Each one made a little pool where it fell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t cry,&#8221; said the Rainbow Cat, &#8220;all will
yet be well. My magic is stronger than his.
When once I get at him I&#8217;ll soon finish him off.
Will you take me to him?&#8221;</p>

<p>But the giantess was afraid; she said she dare
not disturb him. &#8220;Besides,&#8221; she said, &#8220;he would
never let you in, he is so suspicious.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>&#8220;It&#8217;s got to be done somehow,&#8221; said the Rainbow
Cat, &#8220;if you&#8217;re to be set free.&#8221;</p>

<p>He sat softly strumming on his mandolin and
thinking, and suddenly the giantess had an idea.</p>

<p>&#8220;He loves music,&#8221; she said. &#8220;He says it helps
his brain to work. If you could pretend to be a
wandering musician&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The Rainbow Cat leapt with joy.</p>

<p>&#8220;The very thing, my dear,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Have
you by any chance got a peacock&#8217;s feather to
lend me?&#8221;</p>

<p>This the giantess was able to provide.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you very much,&#8221; said the Rainbow Cat.
&#8220;You will see; in an hour&#8217;s time you will all be
free. Good-bye for the present.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was so excited that he jumped clean out of
the window&mdash;mandolin, bag and all.</p>

<p>But he was quite all right.</p>

<p>You know, even ordinary cats are supposed
always to fall on their feet, and of course a fairy
cat&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p>When he reached the ground he wrapped himself
in his cloak, pulled his hat well over his eyes
and stuck the peacock&#8217;s feather in the front of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I look just like a wandering musician,&#8221;
he said, and he went boldly up to the door of the
wizard&#8217;s tower and pulled the bell.</p>

<p>The magician himself came to the door, but he
opened it only the tiniest little bit.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>&#8220;Who are you, and what do you want?&#8221; he
said in a very gruff voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am a poor wandering musician,&#8221; said the
cat. &#8220;May I come in and give you a tune?&#8221;</p>

<p>The wizard looked at him suspiciously. &#8220;What
have you got in that bag?&#8221; he asked, giving it a
kick with his foot, so that the bundle of lightning
made a rattling noise.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got all the major and minor keys in
there,&#8221; said the Rainbow Cat. &#8220;A bunch of them.
That&#8217;s what makes such a rattle. But I can&#8217;t do
without them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sing me a song,&#8221; said the wizard, &#8220;and then
I&#8217;ll see whether I&#8217;ll let you in or not.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the Rainbow Cat sat down on the doorstep
and sang this little song, and the wizard stood
just inside the door and listened.</p>

<p class="center">THE SONG OF THE GOOSE</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="versefirst">&#8220;There once was a goose who lived on a green,</div>
<div class="verse">Gold was his beak and his feathers were clean,</div>
<div class="verse">A handsomer creature there never was seen,</div>
<div class="verse">Heydiddle ho, never was seen;</div>
<div class="verse">He lived on a green and he waddled about,</div>
<div class="verse">For he said, &#8216;To be sure I don&#8217;t want to get stout,</div>
<div class="verse">And, anyway, exercise keeps off the gout;</div>
<div class="verse">Heydiddle ho, keeps off the gout.&#8217;&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think much of that song,&#8221; said the
wizard.</p>

<p>&#8220;The next verse is very good,&#8221; said the Rainbow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Cat. &#8220;But I&#8217;m not going to sing it out here
in the cold night air. I shall ruin my voice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, come in,&#8221; said the wizard, for he
wanted to hear the end of the song, and he let the
Rainbow Cat in.</p>

<p>But no sooner were they inside the wizard&#8217;s
room than the Rainbow Cat opened his bag and
pulled out the bundle of lightning and let it loose
all over the place. You never heard such a
commotion!</p>

<p>Meanwhile he threw off his cloak, leapt upon
the table, and stood there with his hair all standing
on end and his eyes darting green and blue
fire, while the lightning flashed all round him and
round the terrified wizard, who threw himself
down on his knees, crying &#8220;Mercy, Mercy!&#8221;&mdash;for
he had never seen anything like it before and he
was anyway but a cowardly creature at heart.</p>

<p>Presently the wizard&#8217;s attendants came running
to see what was the matter.</p>

<p>They dare not come into the room, but stood
trembling in the doorway.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tie him up,&#8221; commanded the Rainbow Cat in
a great loud voice.</p>

<p>The attendants were not at all fond of their
master, but in any case they were so frightened
of the strange and terrible creature on the table
that they did not dare to disobey.</p>

<p>So the wizard was tied to the table, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Rainbow Cat took all his wicked books and his
pots and pans and the rest of his nasty paraphernalia
and threw them out of the window on to the
ground below, where they were burnt later on
in a great bonfire.</p>

<p>By this time the news had spread all over the
castle, and presently the giantess came in, with
the children trooping behind her.</p>

<p>The wizard had grown black in the face with
rage; he knew that even if he were set free he
would be utterly powerless.</p>

<p>For he had lost all his magic books, and he was
truly rather a stupid wizard and could do absolutely
nothing without them.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact the gentle giantess didn&#8217;t
want him to be punished, and in the end he was
conducted to the borders of the country and
threatened with instant death if ever he returned.
But that, of course, was later.</p>

<p>You can imagine what excitement there was
in the land when the Rainbow Cat appeared the
next day walking down the road from the castle
with the giantess by his side and all the children
running in front, and the wicked magician led
behind in chains.</p>

<p>The Rainbow Cat, having finished his task,
soon bade his friends good-bye and set out once
more on his travels.</p>

<p>The giantess made him a present of the gold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
ring which she wore on her little finger. He
would take nothing else. He wore it as a collar
round his neck, where it was always greatly
admired.</p>

<p>She herself soon became a great favourite
among the people of the Bountiful Land. They
loved her dearly and were very proud of her.
But she always had to be very careful not to
sneeze or stamp.</p>

<p>People even came from other countries to see
her, so that in the end it grew quite embarrassing.</p>

<p>But, in time, a giant who had heard much of
her beauty and gentleness travelled all the way
from Giant-land to visit her, and he married her
and took her away to his own home.</p>

<p>Her trousseau took some making, I can tell you!</p>

<p>All the women in the district sewed at it for
six months&mdash;and even then she was able to have
only six of everything.</p>

Almond Blossom</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap2">LONG ago the leaves and blossoms of the
almond-tree came out together like those on
other trees. But now the blossoms come out first.
Shall I tell you why?</p>

<p>One day in early spring the Fairy Queen was
riding about the country.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I&#8217;m so tired of this
wintry weather. I wish the flowers were out.
And next week is my birthday&#8221;&mdash;the Fairy
Queen, you must know, has birthdays much
oftener than ordinary people&mdash;&#8220;my first spring
birthday this year, and there are still only a few
primroses and violets. How I should love to see
some pink flowers! I&#8217;m so fond of pink.&#8221;</p>

<p>The little buds of the almond-tree heard her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t we manage it?&#8221; they said to their
mother, the tree. &#8220;Can&#8217;t we be out in time for
the Queen&#8217;s birthday next week?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can try,&#8221; said their mother. &#8220;But what
about your brothers, the leaves? You know how
lazy they are. And you can&#8217;t come out without
them. You <i>would</i> look funny.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>The little pink buds did all they could. They
caught every bit of sunshine, they sucked up
every drop of moisture, they grew and grew. But
their lazy brothers would not bestir themselves.
They kept tight folded in their winter jackets.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_077.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too cold,&#8221; they said. &#8220;Br-r-r. Why
should we hurry?&#8221; And so, when the Queen&#8217;s
birthday came, of course they were not ready,
though the pink blossoms were all waiting to burst
into bloom. Presently the Queen came riding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
through the forest on her white rabbit. The sun
was shining and the sky was blue. She halted
under the almond-tree and sighed a little.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had some lovely presents,&#8221; she said. &#8220;A
necklace of dewdrops from the early morning, a
blue velvet cloak from the night, and a basketful
of perfumed kisses from the south wind, who
came such a long, long way to bring them. I
should be perfectly happy if only I had some pink
flowers.&#8221;</p>

<p>The buds of the almond blossom heard her and
quivered with excitement. They could wait no
longer. With one accord they all burst forth into
full bloom. The scent of them was like the smell
of honey.</p>

<p>The Queen looked up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you darlings,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You darlings.
I&#8217;ll have my birthday party under your tree. It
will be the prettiest spring party I have ever had.&#8221;</p>

<p>And ever since that day the pink blossoms have
always come out in time for the Queen&#8217;s first
spring birthday without waiting for their lazy
little brothers. And every year the fairies hold
their earliest revels under the blossoming boughs
of the almond-tree.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><small>ELEVEN</small><br />

The Rondel</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THERE was once a princess who dwelt in a
castle in the midst of a great park. She
lived hidden away from the world in her quiet
home and was scarcely ever seen by strangers.</p>

<p>Rumours of her charm and loveliness, and of
her wonderful golden hair, spread far and wide
over the land, and she was always known and
spoken of as Princess Golden-bright. But her
real name was Gentle.</p>

<p>All round the castle were lovely pleasure-gardens
in which were gay flower-beds and slender,
dancing fountains. But the princess&#8217;s favourite
spot was a circle of ash-trees which stood in the
park some small distance away from the castle on
a little grassy hill with a path leading up to it.</p>

<p>It was called the Rondel.</p>

<p>In the middle of the circle of trees stood a
table with a seat running round it; the ground was
carpeted with soft moss, and the tree-trunks stood
up straight and tall like marble pillars.</p>

<p>The princess loved nothing better than to sit in
the Rondel in the warm weather with her books
and embroidery.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>It was like being in a little house with a high
green roof to it.</p>

<p>Moreover it was a fairy place, and the ash-trees
would often tell her the most delightful stories
of what was going on outside the walls of the
park, for they were so tall that they could see a
long way.</p>

<p>They learnt many things, too, from the birds,
who loved to perch among their branches and to
chatter away to one another about their adventures
in the big world.</p>

<p>The princess very rarely went beyond the walls
of the park, for she was quite happy among the
birds and flowers. But because the beauty of
Princess Golden-bright was famed throughout
the land, many princes sent to ask for her hand in
marriage.</p>

<p>Some of them even came in person, but the
princess would have nothing to do with any of
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am quite happy,&#8221; she said; &#8220;I do not want
a husband.&#8221; However, when she was twenty
years old, her fairy god-mother came to pay her
a visit, and talked to her most earnestly upon this
very subject of getting married, telling her that
it was exceedingly foolish of her to refuse to see
any of these suitors. &#8220;My dear Gentle,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;whoever heard of a princess who was an old
maid? I don&#8217;t say you need choose in a hurry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
but I certainly think you ought at least to see these
gentlemen. You may very possibly find one
among them whom you like, and the ash-trees
will help you to choose if you should be in doubt.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_081.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>So the princess promised to do as her god-mother
wished, and after her departure she made
it known by proclamation that Princess Golden-bright
was willing to receive any suitable person
who might wish to pay her his addresses.</p>

<p>The day after this was done she went as usual
to sit in the Rondel, and while she busied herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
with her embroidery she talked over this matter
of the suitors with her beloved ash-trees.</p>

<p>&#8220;How shall I know whom to choose?&#8221; said the
princess. &#8220;I have no experience at all. If I must
have a husband I should like to be sure that he is
the right one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not be afraid, dear princess,&#8221; replied the
ash-trees. &#8220;You know that whosoever stands beneath
our boughs is bound to speak the truth.
You need ask but one question of each of the
suitors. According to his answer you will be able
to judge of his suitability as a husband.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall I ask him?&#8221; said the princess.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ask him,&#8221; replied the ash-trees, &#8220;what he
most desires in a wife. That will be quite
sufficient.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the princess sat and waited.</p>

<p>Presently she heard a whispering among the
leaves over her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s one coming,&#8221; they said. &#8220;We can see
him riding along the high road.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, what is he like?&#8221; said the princess.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is a very fine-looking gentleman indeed,&#8221;
said the ash-trees. &#8220;He rides on a great black
prancing horse, and a company of twenty knights
rides behind him. He wears shining armour.
The harness of his horse is studded with jewels
and the hilt of his sword blazes in the sunshine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It sounds very exciting,&#8221; said the princess,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
and she put down her stitching and smoothed her
golden hair and spread out the folds of her flower-embroidered
gown, for naturally she wanted to
look her best.</p>

<p>Before long the prince arrived at the castle
gates, and a messenger came out into the park
to tell the princess that he had come from a
neighbouring kingdom to seek her hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will see him here,&#8221; said the princess.</p>

<p>So the prince came riding through the park
with his knights all jingling behind him, each of
them bearing a golden casket containing a present
for the princess.</p>

<p>When the prince reached the foot of the little
hill on which the Rondel stood and saw the
princess under the trees, he dismounted from his
horse and came on foot to where she sat.</p>

<p>The knights waited at the bottom of the hill.</p>

<p>The princess received him graciously, and he
stood before her in the shadow of the ash-trees
and asked if she would marry him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a great kingdom,&#8221; said he, &#8220;great
riches and great power, and my enemies all
fear me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am much honoured,&#8221; said the princess, &#8220;but
I should like to ask you one question. What do
you most desire in a wife?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Obedience,&#8221; said the prince without an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
instant&#8217;s hesitation, for he was obliged to speak
the truth.</p>

<p>The princess smiled a little.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what would you do if your wife disobeyed
you?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whip her,&#8221; said the prince.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am much obliged to you,&#8221; said the princess,
&#8220;but I am afraid that I might not always be
obedient, and I should not like to be whipped.
Good-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the prince rode away home again with his
knights, and the princess went on with her sewing.</p>

<p>Before long she again heard a whispering
among the trees.</p>

<p>&#8220;Another suitor is riding along the road,&#8221; they
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, and what is <i>he</i> like?&#8221; said the princess.</p>

<p>&#8220;He rides on a white horse,&#8221; said the ash-trees,
&#8220;and he wears a blue velvet cap with a white
feather in it. He carries a bunch of roses in his
hand, and behind him ride six gentlemen in gaily
coloured mantles with guitars slung over their
shoulders. He has auburn hair and blue eyes.
They ride at the trot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He sounds rather pleasing,&#8221; said the princess,
and she picked a flower from the syringa bush
which grew at the entrance to the Rondel and
stuck it in her hair.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_084fp.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption">&#8220;IF YOU WILL MARRY ME,&#8221; HE SAID, &#8220;I WILL
SPEND MY DAYS MAKING VERSES ABOUT YOU.&#8221;</p>

<p>The blue-eyed prince was also bidden to come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
out to the Rondel, and he too dismounted from
his horse at the foot of the little hill and came
gaily walking up the path till he stood beneath
the branches of the ash-trees.</p>

<p>He bowed low before the princess and laid his
bunch of roses on the table in front of her.</p>

<p>She smiled graciously, for he was a comely
young man, and he thereupon offered her his hand
in exceedingly beautiful language.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you will marry me,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I will spend
my days making verses about you. They will
be sung throughout my kingdom. I will make a
whole book of them. It shall be called &#8216;Songs of
Queen Golden-bright.&#8217;&#8221; The princess thought
this sounded rather attractive. One does not so
often come across a prince who is also a poet.</p>

<p>But the ash-trees rustled softly above her head,
and she remembered the question that she was
to ask.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you tell me what you most desire in a
wife?&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Beauty,&#8221; said the prince promptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;But supposing,&#8221; said the princess, &#8220;that your
wife fell downstairs and broke her nose, so that
her beauty was spoilt. What then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, then of course I shouldn&#8217;t be able to make
up any more verses about her,&#8221; said the prince.
&#8220;I should get very irritable. How could I bear
to look at a wife with a crooked nose? She would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
certainly have to be most careful not to break
her nose.&#8221;</p>

<p>The princess laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you&#8217;d better get married to a waxen
lady,&#8221; she said. &#8220;If you kept her in a glass case
out of the sun she would remain beautiful for
ever, and there would be no fear of her nose
getting broken. Thank you very much for
coming. I fear that we are not quite suited to
one another. Good-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>The prince bowed low, picked up his bunch of
roses, and rode off again through the park with
his white feather streaming behind him in the
wind.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; said the princess. &#8220;He looked so
very nice, and I&#8217;m sure he must make lovely songs.
But I should always have been afraid of breaking
my nose.&#8221; And she laughed again and took up
her embroidery.</p>

<p>Several more suitors came during the day to
ask for the hand of the princess, but not one of
them gave a satisfactory answer to the question.</p>

<p>One of them thought it above all things desirable
in a wife that she should be able to make a
good pudding; another required that she should
talk very little&mdash;&#8220;which I <i>certainly</i> couldn&#8217;t promise,&#8221;
said the princess; another considered it most
important that she should have twelve bags full
of gold pieces! They all had to tell the truth when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
they stood under the branches of the ash-trees,
and some of them really had the most curious
ideas.</p>

<p>At last, just as the sun was going down, there
came a prince riding on a chestnut horse and
attended only by one squire. He had come a long
way, from a far-off country, and he had ridden
hard, for he had heard much about the lovely
Princess Golden-bright and was afraid that he
might be too late.</p>

<p>In spite of his dusty and travel-stained appearance
the princess was pleased with the look of
him, for he was tall and slender and had dark
curling hair and pleasant grey eyes, and she hoped
very much that he would answer the question
satisfactorily.</p>

<p>When he came to the top of the little hill and
saw the princess he fell on his knee and could find
no word to say, she was so much more beautiful
than he could ever have imagined.</p>

<p>But she smiled kindly at him, and he took
courage and told her how for a long time he had
wanted to come to see her, and that now he feared
he had come too late.</p>

<p>The princess asked him many questions, but
she hesitated to ask the most important of all,
for she liked him better every minute and was
afraid he might not give the right answer.</p>

<p>The ash-trees rustled and rustled as if a wind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
were blowing through them, and at last she felt
she must wait no longer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you tell me,&#8221; she said softly, &#8220;what it is
that you most desire in a wife?&#8221;</p>

<p>The prince was perplexed; truly he had never
thought about the matter. He looked down at
the ground and then he looked up at the trees,
and as he did so they all began to whisper softly.
&#8220;Gentle, Gentle, Gentle,&#8221; they said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, of course,&#8221; said the prince, and he
looked again at the princess and smiled. &#8220;There
is one thing I desire above all else in a wife.
<i>She must be Gentle.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>And what better answer could he have given?
For Gentle indeed she was.</p>

<p>The princess stood up and held out her hands
to him. Her embroidery fell to the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll do, he&#8217;ll do,&#8221; rustled the ash-trees.</p>

<p>But the princess didn&#8217;t even hear them. She
had already made up her mind.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><small>TWELVE</small><br />

Jan and the Magic Pencil</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THERE was once a little boy called Jan, who
lived in a country village. One day he had
the good luck to be able to help a fairy out of a
ditch, where she had got stuck in the mud.</p>

<p>The fairy was very grateful to Jan, and
promised him, as a reward for his kindness, that
he should have what he most wished for in the
world.</p>

<p>Jan was not a very clever boy, and at first he
couldn&#8217;t think of anything to wish for. His
father was a farmer, and Jan had a good home
and plenty to eat and drink; his only real trouble
was that he was always at the bottom of his class
at school. His father scolded and his mother
wept, but Jan always stopped at the bottom. He
wasn&#8217;t so bad at reading and writing, but he
simply could not do arithmetic. His sums were
always wrong, even the quite easy ones.</p>

<p>So when he had thought for a few minutes and
the fairy was beginning to grow impatient, he
decided that the best thing for him to wish for
was that he might be able to get his sums right.
The fairy accordingly gave him a magic slate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
pencil which possessed the power of being able
to do any kind of arithmetic without ever making
any mistake. You simply held it in your hand
and it would write down the answer on your slate
almost before you had time to read over the
figures.</p>

<p>Jan was delighted with his present, which he
put carefully away in his pencil-box. He could
hardly believe that it would do such wonderful
things; but, sure enough, he found he could do
all his sums without the slightest effort, and
that every one of them was right.</p>

<p>Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication&mdash;it made
nothing of them all. Even those dreadful Long
Division sums were no trouble to the magic
pencil: it danced nimbly down the slate without
stopping even for a second, and the answers were
always right. Jan&#8217;s schoolmaster was astonished,
so were his parents, and delighted too, when by
the end of the week Jan had risen to the top of
the school.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a good teacher I am, after all!&#8221; said
the schoolmaster to himself. &#8220;I have even been
able to teach arithmetic to a boy who was so
hopelessly stupid over it that he couldn&#8217;t add up
two and two correctly.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was so proud of this that he actually invited
the principal people in the neighbourhood to come
in and see his wonderful scholar.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>And so it happened that the doctor, the lawyer,
the priest, the mayor and one or two other important
folk from round about arrived at the
schoolhouse one fine day, all agog to see the
schoolmaster&#8217;s wonderful pupil.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_091.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;Come here, Jan,&#8221; said the schoolmaster, &#8220;and
show these gentlemen what you can do.&#8221; And
he wrote out a long sum on the blackboard&mdash;an
addition sum in twenty rows, all bristling with
eights and nines. Poor Jan came forward in fear
and trembling.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather do it on my slate,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>But his schoolmaster wouldn&#8217;t hear of that.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>So Jan had to stand up in front of the blackboard
with a piece of chalk in his hand. Of course
he couldn&#8217;t do the sum at all. It took him a
dreadfully long time and not one figure was right.</p>

<p>&#8220;The boy&#8217;s nervous,&#8221; said the doctor. &#8220;You&#8217;ve
been overtaxing him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lawyer smiled and took a pinch of snuff.
&#8220;I had an idea that our friend the schoolmaster
was rather drawing the long bow,&#8221; he whispered
to the mayor. The priest came and patted Jan&#8217;s
head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Try again, my child,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You&#8217;ll do
better next time.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Jan did no better the next time. If anything,
he did even worse. The schoolmaster was
much annoyed. It made him look so foolish.
When the visitors had gone he gave Jan a good
caning and sent him home in disgrace.</p>

<p>His father and mother were very disappointed,
too, when they heard what had happened.</p>

<p>&#8220;I always knew the lad was a dullard,&#8221; said
his father.</p>

<p>Jan wandered disconsolately out into the sunshine.
It&#8217;s not nice to be called a dullard, particularly
when you&#8217;ve been top of your school for
a whole month. His mother came after him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall have a hot apple pasty for your
supper,&#8221; she said; &#8220;it&#8217;s in the oven now.&#8221;</p>

<p>But even apple pasty couldn&#8217;t console Jan.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>He went into the lane and sat down near the
place where he had seen the fairy. He rather
hoped he might see her again. Sure enough, he
hadn&#8217;t been there five minutes when he felt a light
touch on his shoulder, and there she was, perched
on a swaying wild-rose spray in the hedge close
beside him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, come,&#8221; she said when Jan had told her
his trouble, &#8220;we can soon remedy that.&#8221; And
she gave him a piece of chalk to keep in his pencil-box
together with his fairy slate pencil. &#8220;Now
you will be able to do sums on the blackboard as
well as on your slate,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>Jan thanked her and went home feeling quite
happy, so that he was able thoroughly to enjoy
his supper and his apple pasty.</p>

<p>Things went swimmingly for a while. Jan
did more wonderful sums than ever, both on the
blackboard and on his slate. The schoolmaster
was more careful this time; but he called in first
one person and then another to see what Jan
could do, and now he was no longer disappointed.
Even the lawyer had to acknowledge that the boy
was indeed a marvel.</p>

<p>But alas and alas! After a little time Jan
became so conceited that he was quite unbearable.
He gave himself the most extraordinary airs.
He would hardly condescend to speak to the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
boys. He even patronised his own father and
mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;No boy in the whole country is as clever as I,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;The King ought to see what I can do.
I must certainly go to the Court. How they will
open their eyes!&#8221;</p>

<p>And so one fine day he prepared to set off to
the Court to show the King what he could do.</p>

<p>Now the King of that country was a rather
cantankerous old gentleman, and made short work
of any one who displeased him. Jan&#8217;s mother
didn&#8217;t very much like the idea of his going, but
Jan would not be dissuaded.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will see, mother,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I shall come
home with a bagful of gold, and perhaps the King
will want me to stay at his Court. When I am
grown up I shall marry one of the Princesses, and
you will be able to ride in a golden coach and to
wear a mantle of blue velvet trimmed with ermine.
All the neighbours will curtsey to you and call you
Madam. Wouldn&#8217;t you like that?&#8221;</p>

<p>His mother couldn&#8217;t imagine that she would
like that very much, but she thought it was rather
sweet of Jan to think so much of his mother, and
she gave him a kiss and one of his father&#8217;s best
linen shirts, and bade him be sure not to get his
feet wet.</p>

<p>So Jan set off to the palace, and when he got
there he sent in a message by the beautiful footman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
who opened the door that Jan, the Arithmetical
Wonder, had come to show the Royal
Family what he could do. It was a dull rainy
afternoon, and it so happened that the King,
Queen, and the two Princesses were sitting at
home in their State apartments feeling rather
bored. The Lord Chamberlain, who generally
amused them on wet days by asking them riddles,
had gone to bed with a very bad cold in his head,
and they had nothing to do.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall we have him in?&#8221; said the King to the
Queen.</p>

<p>&#8220;He sounds very dull,&#8221; said the younger
Princess, who was busy making pale blue rosettes
for her bedroom slippers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Better than nothing,&#8221; said her sister, who had
just finished reading all the love-letters that had
come by the morning&#8217;s post, and was pasting the
prettiest ones into an album which she kept for
that purpose.</p>

<p>So Jan was ushered into the royal apartments,
and he told the King and Queen of his attainments&mdash;how
he could do any sum, however difficult,
as quickly as it could be written down, almost
more quickly, indeed. He was a nice-looking lad
and he had no end of assurance, and brought with
him, moreover, letters from all manner of important
personages who had tested his wonderful
powers.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>An attendant was sent to fetch the great Court
account tablets, which were made of ivory inlaid
with silver, and the King offered Jan his own
golden pencil with rubies and diamonds round
the top.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you very much,&#8221; said Jan, &#8220;I prefer a
plain slate or a blackboard, and I always use my
own pencil.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Prefer</i>, indeed,&#8221; said the King, with a great
black frown. &#8220;What business have you to prefer
anything? Slates and blackboards! I&#8217;d have you
know that this is the King&#8217;s Palace and not a village
schoolhouse. If a gold pencil and ivory tablets
are not good enough for you, you can go and
do your sums on the dungeon walls.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jan was very frightened. He didn&#8217;t at all like
the idea of a dungeon, so there was nothing for it
but to brave it out as best he might.</p>

<p>One of the lords-in-waiting was bidden to write
down the sums, and poor miserable Jan wildly
scribbled down the answers as fast as he could,
with the eyes of the King, the Queen and of their
two lovely daughters and all the lords- and ladies-in-waiting
riveted upon him.</p>

<p>But as it happened, the only person at the Court
who was any good at arithmetic was the Lord
Chamberlain, and he, as you know, was in bed
with a cold. It is much easier to put down sums
than to work them out, and not one member of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
the Royal Family had the faintest idea as to
whether Jan&#8217;s answers were right or wrong.</p>

<p>The King looked as wise as he could. &#8220;Very
good, very good,&#8221; he kept saying. The Princesses
clapped their hands. <i>They</i> had never been
able to get their sums right; but after all, what
does it matter whether a princess can do arithmetic
or not?</p>

<p>If one or two of the Court ladies and gentlemen
had a suspicion that the figures were not
quite correct they daren&#8217;t suggest such a thing.
If the King said the answers were right it was
as much as their lives were worth to say they
were wrong. But of course Jan knew nothing
of all this. He wrote on and on, and all the time
only one thought was in his mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;How wonderful, how wonderful!&#8221; he kept
saying to himself. &#8220;I have grown so clever that
I can do the sums by myself. I shall never need
to bother again about the stupid old pencil and
chalk. I really am the cleverest boy in the whole
kingdom.&#8221;</p>

<p>He did not stay very long at the palace, and
he was a little disappointed to find that no one
offered him a post at Court and that he was not
even presented with a bag of gold pieces.</p>

<p>Every one thanked him politely and he was
given a good tea in the housekeeper&#8217;s room, and
the King and Queen shook hands with him and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
gave him a pretty silver brooch to wear in his cap,
while the Princesses smiled pleasantly and wished
him a good journey.</p>

<p>But he was buoyed up by his wonderful discovery.
He went singing along the road, and
when he presently came to a deep pond he threw
his slate pencil and his bit of chalk into the middle
of it, and continued gaily on his way.</p>

<p>You may imagine how badly he wanted them
back again the next day, and for many, many
days after: for of course he was as bad as ever
at arithmetic, and went straight to the bottom of
the class, where he stayed. Many times he went
to the place where he had met the fairy, but she
never came again, for if you once throw away
fairy gifts you never, never get them back again.</p>

The Lamb that Went to Fairyland</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THERE was once a fairy who took a great
fancy to a tiny white lamb. He really was a
dear little creature, and I don&#8217;t wonder she fell in
love with him. She used often to come and visit
him in the meadow where he lived with his
mother, and she was very anxious to take him to
a fairy party some evening.</p>

<p>The little lamb was shy. &#8220;What do you do at
the parties?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dance mostly,&#8221; said the fairy.</p>

<p>But the little lamb explained that he didn&#8217;t
know how to dance.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will soon teach you,&#8221; said the fairy.</p>

<p>So she came every evening when her day&#8217;s
work was done and showed the little lamb how
to dance, and he soon learned to skip about quite
nicely.</p>

<p>At last a day came when the fairy took him
off to the party, but his mother made him promise
to come back the next morning. She knew the
ways of the fairies.</p>

<p>He enjoyed himself tremendously.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>All the fairies admired him very much. They
thought his coat so beautifully white and soft,
they loved his little black nose and quaint woodeny
legs. He gave them all rides on his back in turn
(even the Fairy Queen had one), and when the
time for dancing came he did very well indeed
and astonished them all with his pretty steps.
When he left, the Fairy Queen presented him
with a garland of daisies. &#8220;They are fairy
flowers,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They will never fade, and
so long as you wear them you will remain young.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the lamb got home he had great tales to
tell about his happy adventures, so that he became
quite a celebrity, and every one made such a fuss
of him that he got rather proud and silly, and
after a very short time would hardly speak to
his friends.</p>

<p>Of course this vexed them very much, and the
wicked old rat who lived in the mill-pond and was
always ready to do any one an ill turn, suggested
a way to pay him out for his pride. &#8220;While he is
asleep I will gnaw through his gay garland that
he is so proud of,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and when he goes
out walking he will lose it.&#8221; All of which happened
just as she had planned. And so the foolish
lamb lost his fairy garland and grew older like
any other lamb.</p>

<p>His friend the fairy did not come to see him
for some time. She was very busy helping on all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
the spring things, and had no time for visiting.
When she did come again she was very disappointed
to find that the lamb had grown into quite
a good-sized sheep, fat and comfortable. His
wool was no longer downy and white, and he had
entirely forgotten how to dance.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_101.jpg" alt="" /></div>


<p>&#8220;Where is your magic garland?&#8221; said the fairy.
And he had to confess that he had lost it.</p>

<p>The fairy went back to her friends. She really
did not feel that a big solemn sheep would be very
welcome at their revels. But every year in early
spring when the new lambs are born, their
mothers tell them the story of the lamb that was
invited to Fairyland, and they all go skipping
about in the meadows practising their dancing
steps.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>Each of them hopes that he may one day find
the magic garland, and never grow old and
staid, and be able to go a-visiting to Fairyland.
After all, it must be lying about somewhere, so if
you find it, you&#8217;ll know what to do with it, won&#8217;t
you? But be sure to give it to a lamb with a black
nose. They&#8217;re so much the prettiest.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><small>FOURTEEN</small><br />

The Magic Umbrella</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THERE was once a wizard who possessed a
magic umbrella; and, being rather careless
in his habits, he had the misfortune to leave it
behind him in a small country town where he had
had an appointment to meet a friend in the
market-place at midnight. He left it standing
against one of the wooden market stalls, and there
it was found next morning by a farmer&#8217;s wife
who had come into town to sell her butter and
eggs.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a good, strong-looking umbrella,&#8221; she
said to herself; &#8220;if no one comes to claim it I
shall keep it.&#8221; No one made any inquiries, so she
took possession of it, and when she went home in
the evening, the umbrella went with her.</p>

<p>Now, as I said before, this was no ordinary
umbrella, but was possessed of magic powers.</p>

<p>If you held it open in your hand and counted
three and then stopped, you found yourself in
your own house.</p>

<p>If you counted five, however, you found yourself
where you most desired to be.</p>

<p>But if you counted up to seven, you were immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
carried away to the top of the nearest
church spire.</p>

<p>Now of all this the farmer&#8217;s wife was quite
unaware, and you shall hear what befell her in
consequence.</p>

<p>It chanced to be very wet on the next market
day, and when presently the rain began to drip
upon her bonnet through the canvas roof of the
stall, she was very glad to be able to put up the
umbrella and shelter beneath it.</p>

<p>It was about three o&#8217;clock in the afternoon and
she had sold most of her eggs and butter.</p>

<p>A little boy came along and asked for three
fresh eggs.</p>

<p>&#8220;There you are, my love,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The last
three.&#8221;</p>

<p>She held the umbrella in one hand and with the
other put the eggs into the boy&#8217;s basket.</p>

<p>&#8220;One, two, three,&#8221; she said. And instantly she
found herself standing in the middle of her own
pleasant kitchen, with her basket on her arm and
the open umbrella still firmly held in her hand.</p>

<p>You can imagine how surprised and puzzled
she was. She hadn&#8217;t the faintest idea how she
had got there, but she decided to say nothing
about it to any one.</p>

<p>When presently her husband came in for his
tea he asked why she had come home so early.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>&#8220;I had a bit of a headache,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I think
the sun was too strong for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The farmer gave a great guffaw. &#8220;Come,
come, mother,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you must have been
dreaming. There&#8217;s been no sun to-day, neither
in town nor country.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_105.jpg" alt="" /></div>


<p>&#8220;Well, maybe it was the damp that got into my
head,&#8221; said his wife. &#8220;I think I&#8217;ll go to bed and
have a basin of hot gruel.&#8221; So she went to bed
and had the hot gruel, and by the next morning
she had almost forgotten all about her queer
adventure.</p>

<p>Nothing more happened for some time. The
weather was warm and sunny, and the umbrella
stood unused in the corner of the kitchen.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>But one day the farmer&#8217;s wife decided to go
and see her daughter, who was married and lived
in a village a few miles away. It was a very hot
day and she thought it would be a good plan to
take the umbrella with her to shade her from
the sun.</p>

<p>After dinner she and her daughter went for a
walk upon a neighbouring common, and when
they had gone a little way they sat down for a
rest on a warm dry bit of grass by the side of
the road that ran across the heath, for they were
hot and rather tired.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a lot of motor-cars there are on this
road, to be sure,&#8221; said the farmer&#8217;s wife, who
held the open umbrella over her head. &#8220;One,
two, three, four, five.... I wish I was in one
of them.&#8221; No sooner had she uttered these words
than she found herself plumped right into the
middle of the nearest car, in which were sitting
an old lady and gentleman and a fat spaniel, all
fast asleep.</p>

<p>You can imagine what a scene there was. The
dog barked, the old lady and gentleman were
furious.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop, stop,&#8221; they cried to the chauffeur, who
was driving on quite calmly and taking no notice
at all of the noise going on behind him.</p>

<p>As for the farmer&#8217;s wife, she was so astonished
that she could not say anything at all.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>&#8220;What next?&#8221; stormed the old gentleman,
foaming with rage. &#8220;What next, I should like
to know? How dare you get into our car? How
dare you, madam? What are we coming to? A
pretty state of affairs when a man can&#8217;t go for a
ride in his own car without being molested by
impertinent strangers! Scandalous, scandalous!
I shall report it to the police.&#8221;</p>

<p>The farmer&#8217;s wife had by this time managed
to get out of the car, but she was so bewildered
that she was still unable to speak, and long after
the angry gentleman had driven off with his wife
and his dog, she stood silent and motionless in
the middle of the road with the umbrella in her
hand, wide open, and with her mouth wide open
too. Her daughter, who came hurrying up, was
also very much astonished.</p>

<p>&#8220;What on earth made you do that, mother?&#8221;
she said. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t believe my own eyes.&#8221;</p>

<p>But her mother could only shake her head.
She couldn&#8217;t make it out at all. Never, never
had such an extraordinary thing befallen her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid I can&#8217;t be very well,&#8221; she said at
last. &#8220;I think I&#8217;ll go and see the doctor to-morrow.&#8221;
So the next day she went to see the
doctor. It was rather showery and she took the
umbrella again, for she had never thought of connecting
it with the strange things which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
occurred. The doctor felt her pulse and looked
at her tongue.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got a touch of Thingumabobitis,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;You must be very careful. I&#8217;ll write you
a few prescriptions. You must take a pill every
three hours, and a pink powder every two hours,
and a blue powder half an hour before every
meal, and you must never on any account let your
nose get cold. It&#8217;s not dangerous so long as you
are careful. Come again next week.&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time the sun had come out, and as she
was much taken up with wondering how she was
going to keep her nose warm, the farmer&#8217;s wife
forgot all about the umbrella. Next day, when
she went to fetch it, it was gone. I don&#8217;t know
what happened to it, nor who has it now. But
let me give you a word of warning. If you come
across a stray umbrella, pray be careful not to do
any counting while you have it open in your hand.
It wouldn&#8217;t be very pleasant to find yourself suddenly
hanging from the top of the nearest church
steeple, now would it?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><small>FIFTEEN</small><br />

The Fourth Adventure of the Rainbow
Cat</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">BY this time the Rainbow Cat was getting a
little tired of travelling about, and decided
that he would go home and have a good rest after
his many exertions. But on the way back he had
to pass through the Ever After country, and the
people who lived there were most pressing in their
request that he should spend a little time with
them.</p>

<p>The Ever After country is inhabited by all the
Fairy Tale and Nursery Rhyme people, who go
to live there when their adventures are over.</p>

<p>Cinderella and her prince have a beautiful
castle there, where the glass slipper is kept on a
red velvet cushion in a little gilt cabinet, and
shown to distinguished visitors. Cinderella never
had another pair; she said they were very uncomfortable,
and of course she was always afraid
some one might tread on her toes.</p>

<p>Her two disagreeable sisters have a little house
of their own. They have taken to gardening, and
keep bees and chickens, and are altogether immensely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
improved, so that everybody is quite
fond of them.</p>

<p>They are rather sensitive about their past, and
are both, alas! a little lame, because, as you will
remember, they cut pieces off their feet in order
to make them smaller.</p>

<p>Snow-White, too, lives in a castle with her
husband. The seven dwarfs have a fine carpenter&#8217;s
shop on the estate, where they are kept very
busy indeed.</p>

<p>They make the most lovely little chairs and
tables for Snow-White&#8217;s children, and do most of
the work of that kind required by the dwellers in
the Ever After land.</p>

<p>Red-Riding-Hood and her grandmother have
a pretty cottage close to that of Cinderella&#8217;s sisters.
Red-Riding-Hood often runs in to have a
chat with them, and they are very kind about
sending in honey and eggs for the old lady.</p>

<p>Of course, there are many, many more people.
Jack the Giant-Killer, who has grown rather fat
and lazy, but loves to talk about all his great
fights; Little Miss Muffet, who is still a bit afraid
of spiders; Boy Blue, Mother Hubbard, Aladdin&mdash;it
would take me all day to mention half of
them, but they are all there, not one is missing.</p>

<p>The Rainbow Cat stayed with Fatima, Bluebeard&#8217;s
last wife, who lives with the two brothers
who saved her life by their valour.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>Poor Fatima has never quite got over the
dreadful shock she had when she discovered the
other wives all hanging up, and she can&#8217;t so much
as bear the sight of a bunch of keys.</p>

<p>As usual, the Rainbow Cat was most kindly
welcomed and was introduced to all the important
people in the place.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_111.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>They are always delighted to see strangers, as
sometimes they feel that things are a little dull
after the exciting adventures many of them have
been through.</p>

<p>On the third day after his arrival he was
invited to a great banquet at the palace of the
Queen of Hearts.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>It was a most wonderful banquet.</p>

<p>The Rainbow Cat wore his best bow, his dancing-shoes,
and the gold collar which the giantess
had given him. He took his mandolin with him;
it had been most useful to him on several occasions,
and it seemed a pity to leave it behind.</p>

<p>He met a number of friends at the party.</p>

<p>Puss-in-Boots, for instance, and the Pussy-cat
who went to London to visit the Queen.</p>

<p>Dick Whittington&#8217;s cat was there too, but he
gave himself great airs. It seems it wasn&#8217;t really
quite certain whether he was a fairy-tale cat at
all. Some people thought he was real.</p>

<p>It was silly of him to be so stuck-up about it,
but it only amused the Rainbow Cat.</p>

<p>They were about half-way through the banquet
when there was a slight pause. The meat course
was finished, and everybody was waiting for the
sweets. At that moment a servant came quietly
in and whispered to the Queen. She became
deadly pale, and half rose in her seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the matter, your Majesty?&#8221; said the
Rainbow Cat, who sat in the place of honour at
her right hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s done it again,&#8221; said the Queen in a low,
horrified whisper, sinking weakly down again
into her chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who has done what?&#8221; said the Rainbow Cat.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Knave&mdash;stolen the tarts!&#8221; said the Queen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
with an agonised look. &#8220;They&#8217;re nowhere to be
found. It&#8217;s all my fault. He begged so hard to
be taken on again that I gave him another chance.
Oh! why did I trust him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t there anything else?&#8221; asked the Rainbow
Cat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing ready,&#8221; replied the Queen. &#8220;You
see, they&#8217;re very special tarts. I make them myself.
Every one thinks so much of them. What
shall I do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry,&#8221; said the Rainbow Cat. &#8220;Send
round to all the pastry-cooks&#8217; for anything they
have ready, and meanwhile I&#8217;ll sing a song to fill
up the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Queen was much relieved at this suggestion,
and gave orders that messengers should be
dispatched immediately to buy up all the available
tarts in the place.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Master of Ceremonies was bidden
to announce that their distinguished visitor,
the Rainbow Cat, had kindly promised to sing a
song, and wished to know whether the guests
would like to hear it at this moment or later on.</p>

<p>This was a very clever idea, for of course
people were bound in politeness to say they wished
to hear the song immediately.</p>

<p>Thereupon the Rainbow Cat took his mandolin
and prepared to sing, the whole company being
requested to join in the chorus after each verse.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>They were all delighted with this suggestion,
and they all sang, whether they had any voice
or not.</p>

<p>They enjoyed it so much that they quite forgot
that they hadn&#8217;t finished the banquet. At
least they <i>almost</i> forgot.</p>

<p>Here is the song:</p>

<p class="center">THE RHYME OF THE GNOME WITH A
SCOLDING WIFE</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Once upon a time,</div>
<div class="verse">When guinea-pigs had tails,</div>
<div class="verse">And people talked in rhyme,</div>
<div class="verse">And rivers ran on rails,</div>
<div class="verse">There lived a little gnome</div>
<div class="verse">Who&#8217;d such a scolding wife,</div>
<div class="verse">At last he ran away from home,</div>
<div class="verse">He couldn&#8217;t stand the life.</div>
<div class="indent"><i>Chorus.</i> There lived a little gnome, etc.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">She scolded all day long</div>
<div class="verse">From morning until night,</div>
<div class="verse">And she was never wrong</div>
<div class="verse">And he was never right.</div>
<div class="verse">Oh! she could bake and bile,</div>
<div class="verse">And she could clean and mend,</div>
<div class="verse">But since she scolded all the while,</div>
<div class="verse">He left her in the end.</div>

<div class="indent"><i>Chorus.</i> Oh! she could bake and bile, etc.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">He thought he&#8217;d found a way</div>
<div class="verse">At last to be at peace,</div>
<div class="verse">But still, to his dismay,</div>
<div class="verse">His troubles did not cease.</div>
<div class="verse">He didn&#8217;t like his meals,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
<div class="verse">His washing wasn&#8217;t right,</div>
<div class="verse">His socks were always out at heels,</div>
<div class="verse">His shirts a fearful sight.</div>

<div class="indent"><i>Chorus.</i> He didn&#8217;t like his meals, etc.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>By the end of the third verse the Queen was
looking very strained and anxious, and the Rainbow
Cat himself was beginning to feel rather
nervous. His song had only four verses, and he
wasn&#8217;t at all sure that he would be asked to sing
another. He was afraid that people would
remember their unfinished dinner as soon as he
stopped.</p>

<p>So he began the fourth verse very slowly. But
before he had got half-way through, he saw three
servants standing between the curtains of the
great doorway of the banqueting hall with enormous
golden dishes piled up with most magnificent-looking
tarts.</p>

<p>&#8220;My tarts,&#8221; he heard the Queen murmur in an
excited voice, and then he knew that everything
was well.</p>

<p>So he finished his song at a great pace, and the
last chorus was sung with much enthusiasm, for
the other guests had also seen the waiting tarts,
and were eager to begin on them.</p>

<p>This is the last verse of his song:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;Assuredly,&#8221; thought he,</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Her temper is a curse,</div>
<div class="verse">And yet it seems to me</div>
<div class="verse">That this is rather worse.&#8221;</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
<div class="verse">So home he went once more</div>
<div class="verse">In philosophic mood,</div>
<div class="verse">And though his wife still vexed him sore,</div>
<div class="verse"><i>He did enjoy his food</i>.</div>

<div class="indent"><i>Chorus.</i> So home he went once more, etc.</div>
</div></div>

<p>The song was very much applauded, and every
one then fell upon the tarts with an appetite which
the slight delay had pleasantly renewed.</p>

<p>It turned out afterwards that it was all a mistake
about the Knave.</p>

<p>The head cook had put the tarts away on the
top shelf of the larder for safety. But he was a
poet as well as a cook, and just before the moment
arrived when the tarts should have been served
up, a perfectly beautiful little verse came into his
head, and he rushed off to a quiet spot to write it
down, quite confident that the under-cook would
be able to look after the rest of the banquet.</p>

<p>And that&#8217;s how it came about that suspicion
fell upon the poor Knave; for when the tarts
could not be found, every one naturally supposed
that he had stolen them again.</p>

<p>When the cook had written down his verse and
made a few little improvements in it, he returned
to the kitchen and found everything in an uproar
because of the missing tarts.</p>

<p>He arrived in the nick of time, for the messengers
were returning almost empty-handed
from the pastry-cooks&#8217; shops. They had made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
very little pastry that day because they knew that
every one would be at the banquet and that they
would have no sale for their wares.</p>

<p>Of course, later on, the cook had to give an
explanation of his carelessness, and he was
removed from his position.</p>

<p>But as his verses were even better than his
dishes, he was made Court Poet instead, and he
liked that much better, though he occasionally
lent a hand in the kitchen when they were very
busy.</p>

<p>The Queen was most grateful to the Rainbow
Cat for his timely help; and every year, on his
birthday, she sent him a box of tarts made by her
own hands especially for him.</p>

<p>He stayed only a day or two in the Ever After
land after the banquet. Then he packed up his
belongings, bade good-bye to all his kind friends,
and set off for his home.</p>

<p>He was glad to be back in his own little house,
and delighted all his friends with his account of
his travels.</p>

<p>But he had no intention of settling down for
ever, and I hope to be able some day to tell you
more of the adventures that befell him upon his
further journeyings.</p>

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
